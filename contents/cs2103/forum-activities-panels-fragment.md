**1. :fas-info-circle: Question about association**
</div>

In this diagram, I believe that it is quite clear that there should be a bidirectional association r/s btw action and task. 
However, why is it represented by two unidirectional arrows (one from task to repeatable, one from action to task)? I thought representing it using two unidirectional arrows in this case is not correct.

Upon seeing this, my team thought it was okay to include features that we did not implement in v1.5 (and even in v1.6) in the DG  user stories. Specifically, we included these user stories, even though we did not implement it (we might not even add it in the future enhancements section for v1.6).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/161e52d1-f913-453b-a098-596b03e8d142)

However, it was flagged out as a bug by one of the tester, stating that we are including user stories that is not supported by the current iteration of the application, so our team is a bit confused now.

May I ask whether we could keep the user stories as it is?

    CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -&gt; method2())

I realised that typing `/.gradlew run` in the CLI will only run the AB3 gui, but not in debug mode. For instance, when I set a breakpoint at the `execute` method of the `ListCommand` class, typing `list` in the GUI input will not result in the application stopping at the method `execute`.

A workaround to this issue is to go to the `Main.java` file and press the debug icon (or Shift F9) on the top right corner of the IDE.
Then, the application will  run in debug mode and stop at the breakpoint that I have set.

Hi. according to this [issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/49), there is a consensus on how to style enhanced switch case, where the cases could be indented

I am currently doing the A-CheckStyle task for week 4. I have followed instructions from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) and found checkstyle errors pertaining to the enhanced checkstyle.
Specifically, this is what that had been flagged out as 'errors'.

```java
    public static Command parse(String message) ``{``
        try ``{``
            CommandWord instruction = CommandWord.valueOf(getInstruction(message));
            return switch (instruction) ``{``
                case LIST -&gt; new ListCommand(message);
                case FIND -&gt; new FindCommand(message);
                case MARK -&gt; new MarkCommand(message);
                case UNMARK -&gt; new UnmarkCommand(message);
                case DELETE -&gt; new DeleteCommand(message);
                case TODO -&gt; new ToDoCommand(message);
                case DEADLINE -&gt; new DeadlineCommand(message);
                case EVENT -&gt; new EventCommand(message);
                case ON -&gt; new OnCommand(message);
                case BYE -&gt; new ByeCommand(message);
            ``}``;
        ``}`` catch (IllegalArgumentException e) ``{``
            return new InvalidCommand("");
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

Seems like the enhanced switch case will still have follow the 'no indentation for cases' rule right?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/873fb76c-f2e4-4df6-b67f-1f2acea05e1d)
Under java, it contains all the java classess that I have not packaged yet.
One thing I have noted is that there is no `Main.java` file.

In addressbook-level2, however, the file structure is `src/seedu/addressbook`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63564d81-f954-4a72-b6ed-eed29111a01e)

Under addressbook, there are different packages and a `Main.java` file , which is not the case in my file structure.
I was wondering 

1. why there is no `/main/java` folder in the addressbook-level2's file structure? Is the `main/java` folder needed for compiler to compile java files or can I rename it to other names? According to [maven's suggested project structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) i found online, there is a `/main/java` folder too. 
2. It seems like the `Main.java` in addressbook-level2 contains the main logic, where in my file structure, `Duck.java` contains the main logic of the application. In the case where I wish to follow addressbook's file structure, do I remove `Duck.java` and move it's code into `Main.java`?

I believe that if the commit is already pushed to the remote repo, there is no way where you can edit the commit message without changing the commit id.

Please refer to the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message#) for your reference.

In short, you can use `git commit --amend` for rewriting latest commit
And as week 3 material, `git rebase -i` for rewriting past commits.

Just note that these commands is essentially creating a new commit to replace the old commit that you want to replace, so it is not exactly just an edit to the commit message

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Referring to oracle's documentation on [managing files](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/managingfiles.html):

> Many implementations of the Java platform rely on hierarchical file systems to manage source and class files, although The Java Language Specification does not require this. 

So I believe it is a common convention that is followed by most java platforms, that you should match example.myFile.Abc to the file path `./example/myFile/Abc.java`. The main point here is `Many implementations of the Java platform rely on hierarchical file systems to manage source and class files`, so I guess thats the purpose of needing packages' names to follow the folder path of where the file is.

I might be wrong, but one of the reason could be, when compiler sees
```
// Abc.java file
package example.myFile;
```
, it creates a corresponding Abc.class file at 
```{``outputPath``}``/example/myFile/Abc.class`

Assuming this is the default behaviour of the compiler, it seems logical to me why packages name should follow the folder path, so to match the java filepaths and the class filepaths.

I assume you are referring to the task of created a PR to the upstream repo?

In this case, by creating a PR to the upstream repo, you are essentially asking the upstream repo to review your updates and merge them into the upstream repo.

So if prof approved the PR, your code will be merged into the upstream repo.

(Isn't this exactly the case of contributing to a remote repo owned by someone else?)

delete all your tasks before exiting with 'bye' command.
For eg.

Delete 3
Delete 2
Delete 1
bye
```


For input testing, theres only so much that we can do. You can explore other ways to go around this issue when you actually code test methods.

Or perhaps you can edit your batch script to check if text.txt exist and delete the text.txt file if it does before running ur programme!

Just update your input filePath accordingly!

For example, if you would like to save to
....../ip/src/main/java/test.txt,
filePath should be something like 
'src/main/java/test.txt'

I believe prof is trying to say that it is not recommended to be saving your task data inside the java folder. 

For me personally, I created a data folder specifically just to store data.
so it has the file path of
.../ip/data/test.txt

and so the input file path will be saveTasks('./data/test.txt')

Not sure if thats the best practice tho😂

Also, do check that if that folder exists before writing files to that location. Else you will have to handle that case by creating the folder

Hi, sorry for the late response.

> But in a different context, would it be fine if I omitted drawing an instance of a field having multiplicity as `* `or `0 ... n` in an object diagram?

Yes, thats because * and 0 ... n both includes the case of object A being linked to 0 object B


> And also with respect to the previous example, what if `Square` class had various other fields and we were only interested in 2 specific points, would that make having 2 out of 4 points in the diagram valid?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/805306e1-9caf-480f-909d-6e77b8988a1d)
Based on the notes in this week's topic, they only stated that attributes and name of the object can be omitted. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db511ab0-2a31-46f0-9bf4-8dc826861c2f)
The part on multiplicity also state that if your multiplicity of point is 4, then 1 square must link to 4 points at all times.

> For me I don't actually has method that print out different command error, I had a parent class for Exception (`ToothlessException`) and some inherited class that represent different type of error such as `MissingIndexException`, `MissingDescriptionException` and etc. Each has used the `super(String errorMessage)` in their own constructor to pass the error message to be printed. And I used `try` `catch` in my `main()` method to print the message from the exception via `e.getMessage()`. Not sure is this the best way to do it but it reduce the need to create lots of methods in the `Ui` class to print the messages. Hope it will helps!

May I clarify what you did under the main() method was this?

```java
catch (ToothlessException e) ``{``
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());

My on command search deadline and event tasks that happens on a given date
I converted my tasklist to stream, and then filtered the stream using the provided methods in stream. Then for printing in this case, it could be done with forEach method in stream as well.

The usage was similar to what we did in cs2030s

The briefing mentioned that the main reason for SLAP is to enhance readability and help maintainence of codebase easier, for you and for future developers.

I personally don't think changing the if else to conditional.of.ifblock.elseblock enhance readability. You might want to consult your teammates as well! Considering that you might write all your if else blocks in this format in your TP. 

Also, this is not abstraction right? You are still exposing the check conditions and the steps to execute in the params of the conditional

> Why is varargs unable to determine if a call is passing correct type parameters?

Because varargs are arrays, and you are trying to pass in an Array of generics. They don't go well together.

This was mentioned in cs2030s [here](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2324-s2/24-erasure.html#generics-and-arrays-cant-mix)

> But ArrayList&lt;Pair&lt;String, String>> also reduces to ArrayList during runtime, but the compiler is able to check at compile time if all method calls obey the correct parameter.

Likewise, mentioned [here](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2324-s2/25-unchecked.html)

I feel that the cs2030s notes explained it quite concisely so I won't provide a TLDR ☹  

> then is there not much advantage over just passing a new array that the compiler would inserted in compiletime, with the benefit of not dealing with unchecked exceptions?

The benefit of varargs is that it accepts a variable number of arguments, so we don't have to overload the methods. You can't have an array parameter with variable size.

>@Feng1231 Hmm... that's odd. Could be an issue on the GitHub side. It's not urgent to resolve though. You can triggering CI again to see if it is a temporary issue.

We have tried
1. Creating PRs from each of our member's fork. None of it could be merged until that 'pass CI' check is done (in which it's never updated, even after ~5-10 mins of wait)
2. Pushing new commits to our forks after creating PRs, triggering a re-checking of the Java-CI and code cov checks. Even so, after the new round of check, the 'pass CI' check still won't update.

> @Feng1231 Not related specifically to this issue but you it is best to put the jar file in an empty folder, navigate to the location of the jar file file, and only then run the `java -jar` command. This is because the data files are created relative to the location in which the command is run, and data files created by other jar files can interfere with the running of the current jar file.

Will do that in the future, thank you prof for pointing that out!

I've encountered this too.

Doesn't matter, just carry on with what intellij suggested.

That commit was probably done long time ago. Most likely AB3 had been refactored and constants were moved around after that commit.

The attributes can be viewed as a 'has a' relationship with the instance.
In simpler terms, it means, A person can have a parent, and a person have a child.
Suppose Person A has a child, Person B.
Then A.child = B.
When you look at Person B,
Person B definitely has a parent, which is Person A
B.parent = A.

This is shown by the bi directional arrow in option C,
since both object stores a reference to each other, hence they can navigate to each other

The created or instantiated means that that object did not exist prior to executing this function.

If we follow your logic, 
```
Z z = a.getB().getC().getD().getE()...getZ().doSomething()
can be broken down into
B b = a.getB()
C c = b.getC()
...
Z z = y.getZ()
z.doSomething()
```

will not violate LoD too. 
But does that make sense?

It is our find command. It should be in the format of 
`find [n/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]] [d/DAY [MORE_DAYS]]`
eg. `find n/amy ben d/monday tuesday`

When there is extra preamble text, for example
`find randomtext n/amy ben d/monday tuesday`
Expected: it should fail with an error message
Actual: it ignores the `randomtext` and function as though 
`find n/amy ben d/monday tuesday` was entered

**1. :fas-info-circle: Module / resource for understanding FOSS licenses**
</div>

I came across the GPL2/3 drama between Tuxedo and the linux kernal maintainers, and I realised that licensing is quite complicated. It's clear that those maintaining tuxedo drivers aren't familiar with gpl2 vs GPL3 instead of being malicious. 

I also read how a big thing in FOSS is making sure the *copyright macro* is used, even if author and version macros are not added. 

I see that AB3 is MIT, and from what I understand, MIT, Apache and BSD are permissive and mainly "don't sue us", whole GPL2 is share-alike and must be attributed, and GPL3 has some additional protection that prevents tivoisation (use with drm)

What should us developers keep in mind and how much should we know about licensing?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Bumping JavaFX version (17.0.7 -&gt; 22.0.1) for stability in wayland**
</div>



I'm using Wayland on Linux:

```
OS: NixOS 24.11.20240906.574d1ea (Vicuna) x86_64
Host: HP 8940 
Kernel: 6.6.49 
Shell: zsh 5.9 
DE: hyprland (Wayland) 
```

Right now the current setup for AB3-forked projects use version `17.0.7` as defined in the `build.gradle` file. However, this means the menu-bar in the javafx application does not work (clicking it will make the menu flash and disappear). 

If `javaFxVersion` is edited to be `22.0.1` instead, the menu bar works:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ee531e9-ddd8-4878-8d7e-ac2755e091e1)

(it is still buggy though - I can move the main window with the opened menu stuck in place but that is javafx issue)

are we allowed to either:
1. change the global javaFxVersion to 22.0.1
2. set the version for the linux groups for the components separately to 22.0.1
3. just ignore and hope no one uses wayland on linux

**3. :fas-info-circle: Must immutability be preserved in tP?**
</div>


I understand from #15 that immutability is nor a strict requirement. As we add functionality and create tests, it seems like the immutability aspect of AB3 (specifically the `Person` class) is incurring more trouble than worth. _Especially with the edit command and the editdescriptors and the deep copying for tests_

Are we allowed to modify the immutability aspect, or will that enter into "reworking AB3 instead of adding on" territory? Especially since this project is more OOP based, things like getters and setters can control access and prevent side-effects by returning values instead of direct references to fields.

**5. :fas-info-circle: 💡Find boolean naming violations like se-red-bot!**
</div>

Everyone got that se-red-bot complain but it only checks some files for boolean violations.

Find more:
1. understand what is the violation: `boolean` but not `is...` or `are...` or `should...` or `has...`
3. craft a regex search to find violations: `"boolean [&hat;is|&hat;are|&hat;has|&hat;should]"`
4. find all instances:

if you're on linux/mac, run this at your source root folder:
`grep "boolean [&hat;is|&hat;are|&hat;has|&hat;should]" --color -r .`

if you have **ripgrep**, even nicer:
`rg "boolean [&hat;is|&hat;are|&hat;has|&hat;should]" .`

Windows: I believe there's `sls` or `Select-String` for Powershell but I've given up on windows many years back. Someone else can try it out.

---

Or in IntelliJ:
1. right click the source root folder
2. click "Find in Files"
3. Make sure the regex option is selected (the *.\** icon)
4. search for the violation pattern

**6. :fas-info-circle: Convention for Field Annotations**
</div>


I have seen #227, but I believe this is only for class / method annotations.

In the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.5-annotations) for Annotations, field annotations (4.8.5.4) are instructed to be inline:

> 4.8.5.4 Field annotations
> Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block, but in this case, multiple annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line; for example:
> 
```java
> @Partial @Mock DataLoader loader;
```

However, in the JavaFX tutorial, I noticed that the `@FXML` annotations are on a separate line:
([Example from here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart4.html))
```java
    @FXML
    private ScrollPane scrollPane;
    @FXML
    private VBox dialogContainer;
    @FXML
    private TextField userInput;
    @FXML
    private Button sendButton;
```

Personally I prefer the google way:
```java
    private @FXML Label dialog;
    private @FXML ImageView displayPicture;
    private @FXML VBox labelsVbox;
```

     |  Multiline Error Message
    >

And does IntelliJ tell you to use multiline strings?
```java
final String expected = """ |  Error message here!
                            |  Multiline Error Message
                               """;
```

---

The error is obvious when you reformat this error line:

expected:
```sh 
|  Error message here!
|  Multiline Error Message
 
```

but was: 
```sh
 |  Error message here!
 |  Multiline Error Message
 
```

What you can do is to simply break the multiline string into consecutively concatenated strings. 
```java
final String expected = " |  Error message here!\n"
                      + " |  Multiline Error Message\n";
```

You have better control on whether **the spaces are indentation or intended leading whitespaces**.

**8. :fas-info-circle: Varargs Disadvantage? (Possible heap pollution via varargs parameter)**
</div>

Currently I have a method that uses a signature like `method(Pair&lt;String, String> ... argValues)` where `Pair&lt;K,V>` is a convenience class I have to pair Argument switches and their respective Values

IntelliJ warns `Possible heap pollution via varargs parameter`. I presume this means that when `Pair&lt;K,V>` is compiled, it loses its generic and is a raw `Pair`. But `ArrayList&lt;Pair&lt;String, String>>` also reduces to `ArrayList` during runtime, but the compiler is able to check at compile time if all method calls obey the correct parameter.

Why is varargs unable to determine if a call is passing correct type parameters? And if under the hood varargs `T ... values` are shorthand for `T[] values`, then is there not much advantage over just passing a new array that the compiler would inserted in compiletime, with the benefit of not dealing with unchecked exceptions?

I notice a lot of Issues where the author already bids their thanks for the solution, but then leave it open. However I also understand that some Issues are meant for discussion. 

1. What is the standard we should assume for this forum on when to open and close
2. How should we deal with repeated questions for already answered questions (which author probably missed because they did not omit the "is:open" when searching
3. Should `tips` be left open?
4. How should we deal with multiple tips addressing the same problem? (*I'm looking at you all who gave 101 ways to set coding style in IDEA*)

You can use and abuse `String.trim()` function in your code. Extra trailing white-spaces are *bugs with how you code* and not bugs with the testing / diff / your expected code that requires *hack*ing a fix. 

The main reason to deal with DOS vs UNIX test is because the conflicting `\n` and `\r\n` for newline. 

(important because you should squash this bug in your coding before it becomes too messy. You can't always coax the expected to fit your actual)

If you want to use `Commands` as enum, then use a hashmap `string -&gt; Commands`. If it's static final, then it's allocated once and O(1) effectively. Your switch case can take the value returned by the hashmap.

I am pretty sure that the efficiency of switch cases are in that the input is directly used to jump to an offset on the table (that's why we need to break out of the table at end of each case), through `tableswitch` JVM opcode. Whereas with strings it will just run a `tablelookup` JVM opcode to run a optimised `.equals()` for every case until hit. 

I argue that: 

> String -&gt; Hash -&gt; Hashmap<String, Commands> -&gt; Commands -&gt; switch(Commands) -&gt; jump to case

is faster and more efficient than

> String -&gt; `tablelookup` of O(n) -&gt; jump to case

---

I also argue that it is easier to maintain because you can simply edit the text the user needs to input to run the command:

```java
// Commands is enum
HashMap<String, Commands> commandsMap = new HashMap<>();
commandsMap.put("list", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("delete", Commands.DELETE);

...
// input is String
switch(commandsMap.get(input.lowerCase())) ``{``
case Commands.LIST:
   < Many lines of logic >
   ....
   ....
case Commands.DELETE:
  < More more LoC>
   ....
   ....
``}``
```

Suppose tomorrow we gonna **i18n** to worldwide.
We will not want to *manually edit each and every single switch case*!!!

we can simply do this:

```java
// Commands is enum
HashMap<String, Commands> commandsMap = new HashMap<>();

// english
commandsMap.put("list", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("delete", Commands.DELETE);
// tamil
commandsMap.put("பட்டியலிடுகவும்", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("அழிக்கவும்", Commands.DELETE);
// mandarin
commandsMap.put("列印", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("删除", Commands.DELETE);
```

and you never need to touch the switch case ever again.

> > By testing private methods you are testing the implementation. This defeats the purpose of unit testing, which is to test the inputs/outputs of a class' contract.
> 
> So I guess in your specific situation, instead of trying to test directly on private fields of TaskList, you may test through its exposed interfaces (there should be some public method like getTask()).


If  InputState ---Command--> OutputState is deterministic, think about how we'd do it for another input/output:

```java
// testing function "int square(int)"
int input = 3;
int expected = 9;
int output = square(input);
assertEqual(expected, output);
```

So for your command you're testing,

```java
// testing function "oogaBooga(TaskList t)"
TaskList list = new TaskList(Task a, Task b);
int expected = new TaskList(Task x, Task y);
oogaBooga(list);
assertEqual(expected, list);
```

If you do this you **will fail** because by default, all Object subclasses'  `.equals(Object other)` will compare the pointer address in the heap. What you need to do is to Override `.equals(Object other)` like we did in CS2040S. so you can compare if the new state of `list` is exactly what you expected in `expected`.

This will let you:
1. Test the command function
2. Not touch the `TaskList` private functions

If you want to go through the gradle route of checkstyle, you must update the `build.gradle` file to include `id('checkstyle')`, and add the dependency for checkstyle (using the correct toolset version)

If done right, you can run the above command and you'll get a lot of errors, and a link to a generated html file detailing all the errors.

Try using relative path from the **root directory of the project**. Most likely the files are being generated into different `out` folders depending on whether it is main or test. Ideally `src/test/resources/` for jUnit tests

Doing `git push origin :refs/tags/``{``old-tag``}``` (ie pushing "nothing" to the tag) yields the same result of deleting the tag 

Either way is fine

I guess both our tips are better combined as:

1. Removing local / remote tags
2. Adding local / remote tags

Such a trick question!

But to be honest, the question itself looks like 4-space tabs are being used. I think that's the confusion. 

---
Also sure if you're using checkstyle from Google or ide defaults, to change:
1. Indentation tab from 2 -&gt; 4
2. No indentation for "case" statements

Because Google standards, and ~~"nulls are a billion dollar mistake" mod~~ CS2030S use 2-space tabs and indented case statements.

Import statement order is also a bit different. Make sure it's static > java > javafx > org > com > samepackage

I want to add on, if anyone is facing this issue and have correctly set the java path to point to java17, but face this issue, check if the IDE is using the **correct gradle file**. 

_File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle_

Choose `Local Installation` for _Distribution_, choose the gradle folder that you should have merged into your local repo. Also ensure the _Gradle JVM_ is `17`.

**TL;DR** because `*` by default does not include _hidden files_ (starting with `.`). to include them you need to also run `git add .*`.
---

`*` wildcard (globbing) is not a git-specific thing, but dependent on the shell you are running. Shells like _bash_ and _zsh_ define the behaviour of what `*` globs. You can edit them in their respective config / `rc` files.

The default behaviour of `*` only includes non-hidden files, which means anything starting with `.`, ie `.gitignore`, will be ignored.

---

- `git add -A` or `git add -All` If you're trying to add *ALL* files (that are not excluded by `.gitignore`)
- `git add -u` if you only want to add all **currently tracked** files (**This is most often used**)
- `git add -f &lt;File>` to forcefully stage a _currently ignored_ file.

If you're on linux, you can check your desktop environment's Default Association (xdg-mime). Or use a `.desktop` file to launch. Honestly in linux, more often than not it will just open a archive extractor (like 7zip) to extract the files.

> After understanding what I need to interface with the GUI, I've come to the conclusion that my current codebase needs quite a bit of refactoring.

If it's to do with the main loop depending on `Scanner` blocking until input is available, you can get around with:

&lt;details> &lt;summary> what i did basically &lt;/summary>

1. extracting that `hasNext()` into an abstract method in `Ui` interface
2. have 2 different classes implement `Ui`, with the *cli* version's `hasNext` `running scanner.hasNext()`
3. **Cry** for awhile realising you need to implement some concurrency stream implementation for GUI (**This is important** because you know you should not exert too much effort into this but you can't help it)
4. Make your UiGui implementation of `Ui` hold a buffer of input and outputs. Basically instead of `System.out.println` going to `STDOUT` and scanner reading from `STDIN`, implement a _blocking_ function to busy wait until the input buffer / output buffer is not empty anymore and return true (or return false when your bot has ended, indicating a _closed stream_)
5. Run your bot in a new `Thread` so that it will concurrently pull from `UiGui`-IN and push to `UiGui`-OUT
6. Run another loop in your `MainWindow` (probably in the init method) class to run a new `Thread` to repeatably check if the Output buffer is not empty, and then _print_ it out as the bot's dialogbox

&lt;/details>

**tl;dr**
1. encapsulate Ui to be an interface doing the STDIN/OUT/ERR. Cli implementation can use normal System.out and System.in
2. Run your bot in a new thread so that it can _busy wait_ for _Input_
3. Run a seperate thread in your GUI application to _busy wait_ for _Output_ and **signal the main app to add new `DialogBox`s when output availabe (ie bot replies)**

Some caveats:
- &lt;details> &lt;summary> JavaFX updates must happen on the JavaFX line. &lt;/summary> Use `Platform.runLater(updateMethod)` to run a `updateMethod()` that does the `Ui.StdOut->DialogBox->Add to scene` &lt;/details>
- &lt;details> &lt;summary> I had to use a flag to add a guard clause in my update method. &lt;/summary> Idk why even though I only execute the `runLater` when the busyloop continues, it still gets stuck afterwards. _I think `Platform.runLater` might be executed once, so the new thread only needs to update the flag and not call it again. I will need to try this._ &lt;/details>
- Your program will be a bit slower on startup.

Why I did it this way:
- My bot says hello before the user inputs, so I don't want to have edge cases to handle with beginning and replying only when user inputs. Very messy.
- I am programmer. of course I will waste hours automating something that can be hacked away in minutes
- My CLI still works. [Run my .jar](https://github.com/yadobler/ip/releases/tag/Level-10) with `-c` flag to use CLI instead of GUI. This means my `Text-ui-test` still works, so **regression testing still works**
- I dont have to touch my main bot class anymore. All logic remains same. If tomorrow @damithc says the bot needs to run on brain with the input coming from my thought and output injected to my eyes, i just need a new `UiBrain implements Ui` class and add a new method to my `Launcher` static class to create the appropriate Objects for the bot.

1. Can you post your 'build.gradle' since the './gradlew checkstyleMain' is based off that, instead of the plugin.

You can try to:
1.go to '.idea' folder and 
2. delete 'idea-checkstyle.xml', 'modules' folder, and 'gradle.xml'
3. Then close and reopen Intellij
4. Rebuild gradle by pressing the tiny little elephant icon on the right
5. Reconfig the Checkstyle plugin (File->Settings, search checkstyle, then add the local file and name it and then add on the next window that pops up) then try again

If all else fails, try to File->Invalidate cache and try again

I believe both does the work, but if you're pushing to production, compiling **without** the -ea flag will silent all `assert` statements, even if triggered. Throwing AssertionError means in production release your product might throw an error to the very very confused user (if it is not caught or handled). Might save you some embarrassment or tech support voes.

very evil but I don't trust the user to handle AssertionErrors, even though the programme will now be in an undefined state. I guess that's up for discussion 

also note that unless you `catch (Error e)` or `catch (Throwable e)`, it won't be caught. Usually we catch `Exception`s but never catch `Error`s (unless threading i think).

Hello! Great point. I decided to keep the CLI, by separating the bot into its own object, and use another `Ui` interface that determines the contract between the bot and the I/O. Then I used one with CLI and one with GUI and then have the launcher class decide which UI to attach to the bot.

Choice is done with a switch (`-c` for CLI, omit for GUI) when running. If needed, this can be placed in a `.ink` or `.desktop` shortcut file.

I'll copy paste my comment [from another issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/244#issuecomment-2337727375):

3. **Cry** for awhile realising you need to implement some concurrency stream implementation for GUI (**This is important** because you know you should not exert too much effort into this but you can't help it)
4. Make your UiGui implementation of `Ui` hold a buffer of input and outputs. Basically instead of `System.out.println` going to `STDOUT` and scanner reading from `STDIN`, implement a _blocking_ function to busy wait until the input buffer / output buffer is not empty anymore and return true (or return false when your bot has ended, indicating a _closed stream_)
5. Run your bot in a new `Thread` so that it will concurrently pull from `UiGui`-IN and push to `UiGui`-OUT
6. Run another loop in your `MainWindow` (probably in the init method) class to run a new `Thread` to repeatably check if the Output buffer is not empty, and then _print_ it out as the bot's dialogbox

&lt;/details>

**tl;dr**
1. encapsulate Ui to be an interface doing the STDIN/OUT/ERR. Cli implementation can use normal System.out and System.in
2. Run your bot in a new thread so that it can _busy wait_ for _Input_
3. Run a seperate thread in your GUI application to _busy wait_ for _Output_ and **signal the main app to add new `DialogBox`s when output availabe (ie bot replies)**

Some caveats:
- &lt;details> &lt;summary> JavaFX updates must happen on the JavaFX line. &lt;/summary> Use `Platform.runLater(updateMethod)` to run a `updateMethod()` that does the `Ui.StdOut->DialogBox->Add to scene` &lt;/details>
- &lt;details> &lt;summary> I had to use a flag to add a guard clause in my update method. &lt;/summary> Idk why even though I only execute the `runLater` when the busyloop continues, it still gets stuck afterwards. _I think `Platform.runLater` might be executed once, so the new thread only needs to update the flag and not call it again. I will need to try this._ &lt;/details>
- Your program will be a bit slower on startup.

Why I did it this way:
- My bot says hello before the user inputs, so I don't want to have edge cases to handle with beginning and replying only when user inputs. Very messy.
- I am programmer. of course I will waste hours automating something that can be hacked away in minutes
- My CLI still works. [Run my .jar](https://github.com/yadobler/ip/releases/tag/Level-10) with `-c` flag to use CLI instead of GUI. This means my `Text-ui-test` still works, so **regression testing still works**
- I dont have to touch my main bot class anymore. All logic remains same. If tomorrow @damithc says the bot needs to run on brain with the input coming from my thought and output injected to my eyes, i just need a new `UiBrain implements Ui` class and add a new method to my `Launcher` static class to create the appropriate Objects for the bot.

I believe it's because of [this line](https://github.com/RezwanAhmed123/ip/blob/master/build.gradle#L5)

```gradle
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.1.0'
```

If you remove this line, you do not need to specify the javafx modules used like this.

However, instead you'll need to list each module's source in the dependency block (ie the `win mac linux` for the base, graphics, etc...)

Not sure what's the difference but they give the same result

@winstonlimjy just wanna address a code smell - suppressing checkstyle warnings

For [this line](https://github.com/winstonlimjy/ip/blob/master/src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fstorage%2FStorage.java#L15) you might want to either use CamelCase, or if you feel it's a constant, then change `PATH` to use `static final`.

`final` alone is immutable but still specific to each object instance. ALL_CAPS_CONSTS are for static finals, which jvm will store separately in program memory instead of in the heap with each object

IIRC usually you declare the variable before the switch, but don't assign it. Then in each case statement you can assign the Id.

I see "Type x = y" as actually 2 different operations, a definition and assignment. So you can break it into 2 statements and then the common statement (ie the definition) will be brought out to before the switch. 

Personally I try to extract as much common statements out as possible, and make each case statement only what's specific to the case. 

```java
int id;

switch (command) ``{``
case MarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new MarkCommand(taskList, id);

case UnmarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD: 
    id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new UnmarkCommand(taskList, id);
``}`` 
```
(I'm assuming `id` will have different assignment in other cases? If not you can also just straight away assign it before the switch) 

But I like the brackets too, they help define the local scope. Reminds me of rust `match` blocks.

Like what @verakohh said, probably if you run using Gradle your relative path `./data/flash.txt`will be from the root, while running via IntelliJ will retrieve the file from **current working directory**

If you're highly motivated you can compile a custom checkstyle module as [suggested by chatGPT here](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e3c7f5-97cc-800f-9b03-2335ef20d47f)

Then import it to your checkstyle.xml

Is CLI ok?

You can use
1. For last commit you can use: `git commit --ammend`
2. Add `-m` if you want to directly input the message in the command, **with quotes**, instead of having git open your text editor (Eg `git commit ammend -m "Fix stuff"`) 
3. If it's few commits down, add `-c &lt;commit id>` where commit id can be found in your `git log`
4. If the commit was already pushed to github, push again with the force tag: `git push -f`

There's also interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`) which is more powerful, but this should suffice.

Changing the if-else blocks to streams might not help if it's gonna be the same _multiple levels of abstraction_ for each conditions. 

Also i agree with @Feng1231, rewriting if-blocks to `Conditional.of()` is not abstraction. I'd argue you're making it even more messy. You're actually introducing **another** level of abstraction, by introducing a new `Conditional` class and running your existing code in them.
 
You might want to see i you can throw the inner blocks into separate methods, and call them in each `else` block. 

Try using switch if possible when there's too much `if`s.

I assume you're having a factory method so that `Storage` components and `Command` components can create tasks without conflicting each other?

---

Might also help to have it `abstract`ed in the `Task` base class and then have each subclass override the factory method by:
1. calling super
2. taking the _new Task_ and then casting into an instance of the subclass
3. adding additional details like deadline via private setters
4. returning the new SubclassTask

you can also skip (2) by:
1. declaring your `Task` as a `abstract class Task<T extends Task>`
2. Make the factory method return a new `T`
3. Make your subclasses extend `Task` like `class Deadline extends Task<Deadline>`
4. Override factory method in subclass to run `super.FactoryMethod( stuff )` and set a local var to it
5. then add additonal stuff like (3) and (4) above

---

That's how i kinda did mine.
My "factory method" is more of a Command object.

I have a base command class, which takes in the string slices and pushes them into hashmaps. Then each subclass that extends this class has a `runCommand` method that will look into the hashmap for required arguments. This also frees up the argument order, since the parsing method sees the command as:

```VERB [first argument] [/flag1 [flag1 arguments]] ... [/flagN [flagN arguments]]```

<details> 

<summary> I also did something more complicated </summary>

Because I didnt like the nature of only being able to check runtime for ensuring what each argument flag is called. I had the abstract class define a generic `<A extends Enum<A> & ArgEnum<A>>`, and in interface `ArgEnum` i define the methods I want each subclass enums to abide to (ie they must hold a string that defines the flag keyword and a boolean isRequired like `START_DATE('/from', true)`, and then my parser is able to check if all arguments are satisfied, else throw an exception to be caught.

</details>

So. 

1. I have a `CommandBase` class
2. I have a `CreateTaskCommandBase<T extends Task> extends CommandBase` class, which has a `protected T newTask` field for the newly created `Task` object, and code to fetch `Args.TASK_NAME` and `Args.IS_TASK_DONE` from the hashmap 
3. I have a `CreateXXXTaskCommand extends CreateTaskCommandBase<XXX>` which calls `super.run()`, then takes the `newTask` and does things like `newTask.setDeadline(map.get(Args.DEADLINE))` taking the data from the hashmap
4. Then return the task (I use a separate getter so that my `run` commands all can `return this` and i can chain them like stream)

Have a look at #184, there is discussion regarding whether arrowhead-switch statements should be indented or not, since SE-EDU guidelines predate this feature.

Your issue is related to the fact that the SE-EDU guideline, as well as checkstyle, was never designed with _switch expressions_ (ie switch blocks that evaluates to a value) in mind. So consequently it was not designed for `switch` to be pushed in from its statement's indentation level.

So the question here is, do you want the `case` statements to align the level of the statement that has `switch`, or do you want it to be _1 level left_ from the `switch` line's indentation level? 

#184 prefers the latter (what your ide is doing now), but checkstyle will disagree. It's very whishy-woshy. 

You can use and abuse the checkstyle-suppression and intellij-suppression comments to disable checking this block in the meantime, and manually adjust the spacing.

No easier way.

The traditional way (ie with gdb and vim, or with jdtls) is to first launch the java app with the following args:   

```-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005```   

you're instructing java / Gradle to:
- run as a server (`server=y`) and wait for a client to connect to remotely debug
- enable suspending the programming (`suspend=y`) 
- listen to port 5005 (`address=5005`)


Then on IntelliJ, you must start the remote debugging client, set the port to 5005, and begin

----


Or you can just press the 🐞 debug icon. Either 

- on the top right
- on the same line as your `static void main` entry point
-  in the bottom under the _services_ tab, choose your desired config (run, test, checkstyle) and choose debug

----

If you run Gradle with debugging, you can use nvim with the dap plugin or any client that supports the debugging adaptor protocol to follow along.

And this includes using things like gdb for c debugging or python too.

> I realised that typing `/.gradlew run` in the CLI will only run the AB3 gui, but not in debug mode. For instance, when I set a breakpoint at the `execute` method of the `ListCommand` class, typing `list` in the GUI input will not result in the application stopping at the method `execute`.

Sorry can I clarify, are you able to stop at breakpoint before doing GUI? (ie you hit breakpoint and programme pauses when the programme was still CLI mode and you typed list in the CLI) 

Expected behavior is that debugging is not enabled when you `. /gradlew run`.

I feel like I'm misunderstanding something.

I talked about it [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/255#issuecomment-2342348083)

Final variables only mean they are immutanle _for each object instance_ but making it static final means they are _globally immutable_. 

JVM will store _static final_ separately in the program `DATA` section, but finals without static will still be allocated on heap with each instance of the class initialised. 

---

Now, some standards agree that finals should also be ALL_CAPS. Some don't. For this course, we reserve this to only the static finals.

There's an option in the `checkstyle.xml` if you wanna disable it, for future uses

Alright! My teammates decided we will add depandabot.

For anyone else wondering, admin can go to the security page of repo and enable all 5 of the depandabot accesses

Try deleting `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.gradle` and running gradle again

Running gradle should give a clue as to which file in the dependency cache is corrupted but you can just clear all the gradlew cache files and try again

(on Linux/mac: `~/.gradle`)

I think no2 does not because the interaction with Person is encapsulated within the method (ie it's the lesson's problem to settle with its friend), and any method calling lesson only needs to deal with lesson's `gerPersonName` method without having to go behind the friend (lesson)'s back to talk to person and get the name

No1 would, cos you're talking to your friend (lesson)'s friend (person)

-----

That being said I think in both examples, `getName().fullname` is a bit antipattern. It's not Slapping hard and it's accessing field members is a big nono, especially if FullName might change or depend on object state. 


Actually I think it's also violating the Law of Damither cos "getName" returns what I assume is a `Name` object which contains the field `fullName`.

Best to have Person give the full name itself. Like `Person::getFullName`.

Actually the `getPerson` method itself is misleading, it's really doing a `getPerson().toString()` but I think that's OK because again it's encapsulated within the friend method without exposing the friend to the other friend.

`person.getName().fullname` feels like person is exposing their friend (name) to the other friend (lesson)

----

But it's all design pattern I guess. I don't know if maintaining decoupling outweighs the extra method in Person - I guess it would if that's the only reason why Lesson has to know what `Name` does. If it is already coupled for other reasons then I think the three of them are all good friends with each other and


----

That being said, if a friend of Name and Lesson does a `lesson.getPerson().getName().fullName()` **which will not work BTW because getPerson returns a String not Person**, but assume it returns Person, it will violate SLAP

And I guess if one day you decide this popular mutual friend decides to ditch `Name`, it will need to still be coupled with `Name` because both `Lesson` and `Person` aren't helping it and is forcing it to deal with `Name` directly.

Sad

@damithc yup it is possible to use it as normal (ignoring the menubar issue). 

I have not tried i18n input yet, but I believe it might also be a problem with wayland (as seen in electron apps) - it is fixable by setting some env vars (see below), in particular the `gtk` one. 

I think the only main caveat is openjfx needs to be installed in addition to openjdk (for java >= 11). 

---

Depending on the system, `_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING` needs to be set. 

 I think this is not wayland or jfx related, it's a more broader problem with java and Linux (and how java reacts to different DEs) - this issue pops up when trying to run native java apps like ArduinoIDE and even IntelliJ. It might be related to swing. 

---

I18n fixes:
```
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
SDL_IM_MODULE=fcitx
XMODIFIERS="@im=fcitx" 
```

I think it is great for ubuntu / Debian users, which should cover most uses.

I am comparing it to the [arch linux wiki for java](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Java ), which is overly comprehensive but targeted to arch / pacman package management / manual installation.

And I feel if anyone's using arch, they are competent enough to figure out how to get their system working

So I think it might be alright

---

The only issue is that openjfx 17 does not natively support wayland, so the xwayland fallback is very buggy. V21 onwards apparently is supposed to solve this.

I know there's an active development by Oracle (project Wakefield) to natively support wayland.


For now javafx 17 works fine, unless trying to open the menu.

**TLDR**

- Performance wise: no impact (on release). 
- Use until ~~shiok~~ you feel it is enough / it starts diminishing in value of readability
- asserts are a _debugging / development_ tool - assume they will vanish in prod and use guard clauses instead for unavoidable exception states that can happen in prod, so that the programme _gently_ errors out and not explode in the user's face or silently run in an invalid state. 

----

Java is mostly JIT-compilation and without explicit `-ea` flag, the JIT-compiler will drop the `assert` bytecodes. `assert` statements are in theory supposed to be ignored in release files (ie for debugging purposes). You cannot have assert statements annihilating the whole program - you want to fail silently (and *log* it). So in testing, you'd run `java` with `-ea` flag (**enable assertions**). 

By default, the behaviour is to run with assertions disabled (`-da`)[&hat;1]. 

[&hat;1]: More on the flag [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-7930/6jgp65ikq/index.html), including how to specifically choose which class to enable and disable assertions with the cli flags

----

2103 being 2103, it's a perfect qn to ask in terms of code quality, ask yourself:

**Can you understand the code you wrote yesterday with the assert statements everywhere?**:
- Yes: ~~not enough asserts~~ it's fine
- No: stop. 
  - That being said, I feel like asserts should ideally start/end a segment of code. You need to break your wall of code with newlines. Else it feels like reading an essay with no paragraphs. 
  - `assert model != null` is duplicating the `requireNonNull(model)` code. 

----

I also agree with @Incogdino. Ask yourself if the checks are:
- recoverable exceptions; or
- unrecoverable errors / invalid states

A user entering invalid command is still a valid state with an exception that you raise and then catch and process. That should be *in the release*. 

A user entering invalid command and the app successfully accepts without throwing exception? That is an invalid state - it should be caught in development and the program must burn and crash. 

If you think it that a "not happy" state can be encountered in production and should be *recoverable*, hmhm, like how AB3 is able to populate a new `addressbook.json` if it is missing / is corrupted (This means it is not an _invalid state_ - it's just another valid state with exception), then you may want to "incorporate" this assert checking into actual code as an exception instead.

Ignore IntelliJ. It's rendering with basic markdown. This also happens with jekyll backend

For jekyll users, you can install Ruby, then bundle via gems, and then jekyll via bundle, and then render the site locally

For markbind I'm not sure.

---

A good trick is to temporarily set your own personal github fork to deploy from the `docs` folder of the &lt;branch with UG/DG updates> branch and then view the result in `&lt;your username>.github.io/tp`

It also allows your peers to review.

Once merged, undeploy branch

Only caveat is you can only preview one branch at a time.

> (i.e., what kind of bugs you plan to look for), you can share in this thread.

Hello, struggling student from current batch here. Here are my tips for catching bugs:

1. **Divide and Conquer with a Net**  
   Place your net down the middle of a room or yard and systematically close in, dividing the area in half each time. Efficient, precise, and gets those bugs faster.

2. **Set Up an Array of Traps**  
   Use multiple types of traps spread out across different spots to ensure every kind of bug gets caught. If one doesn’t catch them, another will!

3. **Use a Pheromone Trail**  
   Set out pheromone-based baits in strategic spots. These scents lure bugs directly to your traps for a quick and easy catch.

4. **Create a Circle of Light**  
   Bugs love light—so place bright lamps in a loop around your outdoor space to lead them into one well-defined area, away from your home.

5. **Upgrade Your Bug Spray Arsenal**  
   Keep different bug sprays on hand, as each one works best for different pests. Rotate and test sprays to see which works best over time.

6. **Run Daily Clean-Ups**  
   Bugs are drawn to crumbs and scraps, so sweeping and wiping down every surface daily keeps the place spotless and unappealing to them.

7. **Install a Perimeter Barrier**  
   Create a barrier of citronella or essential oils around doorways and windows. This “firewall” keeps pesky bugs from coming in.

8. **Optimise Trap Placement**  
   Set traps in places you notice high bug traffic—corners, window sills, and near food. Placement is key to catching as many as possible!

9. **Make a Bug Catalogue**  
   Write down notes on what bugs you find and where, so you can spot patterns and put your traps in the best possible places each time.

10. **Divide and Conquer with Extra Hands**  
    Enlist friends or family to help with bug-catching efforts in multiple rooms, creating a team for efficient, faster results.

11. **Use a “Swatter with Memory”**  
    If you have a swatter, designate one for each bug type and use it consistently. It’ll “remember” each bug and help you target with precision.

12. **Install a Bug-Detecting Device**  
    Put a couple of sticky strips in dark corners where bugs tend to hide. They’ll do the bug-detecting work for you!

13. **Set Up a Honey Trap**  
    Place a small dish of honey or sugar water where bugs are likely to find it. They’ll be drawn in by the sweet smell, and you can easily catch them.

14. **Follow the Water Source**  
    Bugs need water to live, so check under sinks and near drains. Finding where they get their moisture can help you pinpoint their hangouts.

15. **Place Traps in Entry Points**  
    Bugs often get “stuck” at windows or doors. Place sticky traps there to catch them before they make it into your living space.

16. **Use a Flashlight for Detection**  
    Shine a flashlight in dark areas where bugs might be hiding—under couches, in corners, or in cabinets—to reveal their hiding spots.

17. **Set Out Fruit to Lure Them**  
    Place a piece of fruit near your traps for a natural, safe lure. Bugs can’t resist ripe fruit, so they’ll come to investigate!

18. **Set Up Nightly Spraying Routines**  
    Spray your favorite bug repellent every evening. Bugs tend to come out after dark, so a consistent nighttime routine keeps them at bay.

19. **Keep a Bug Log**  
    Jot down when you notice specific bugs and where they seem to congregate. This helps with future pest control planning.

20. **Set Up “Watch Lights” Outside**  
    Install bug zappers or outdoor lights a little distance away from your house to keep bugs occupied and away from doors and windows.

Hope this helps. Singapore is very humid and there are lots of bugs, so it can get difficult managing them

---

Watch out for pests like cockroaches - they are bad and sometimes a source of smells. They also start to overflow if unchecked too, and visibility in day can be a sign of your buffers or traps being exceeded.

What if the UG pdf was incorrectly exported, rendering all links nonworking and inhibiting both the copying of commands, as well as the searching of commands (ie the entire pdf is image-based)?

Since this is not about the content of the UG but the "formatting" of the UG itself (ie one argument is that the UG pdf is not going to be used and that the website is sufficient for users), do we judge this as a "Documentation Bug" or is it a "Feature Flaw" and is it considered high severity?

- how does it compare to the [tp-constraints for screen size](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-constraints.html#constraint-screen-resolution)?
- "default size" as in, immediately when opened and is not "maximised"?
- "fullscreen" meaning "maximised"?

also
- not related but technically not "fresh install" since jar files are "portable" (it is also a constraint to not have anything installed)

Also, overloading occurs within the class, and you can think of it as "one name, different flavours". You can say that the same name is _overloaded_ with different possible input variables. **different signatures**

Overriding is "hiding" the inherited function and putting a brand new function _over_ it. You can say that it _overrides_ the parent function. **same signature**.

---

If you dig deeper, Overriding is processed ~~compile time (javac)~~ runtime (jvm) by using the new function instead of copying the parent function, which allows the object to run its own version of the method while still being able to take the place of the superclass instance.

Overloading is done in ~~runtime (jvm)~~ compile time (javac) where ~~jvm~~ javac does some weird stuff to decides to widen the scope or unbox the passed variable, Lowkey like on-the-spot overriding but that's not impt. (unfortunately it's not syntatic sugar like other languages that does function mangling, where overloading is secretly having two different functions that the compiler will resolve for you)

@somethingfishyfishy good catch!

My bad. Yes it's the other way. Overriding is runtime (jvm) since the funky subclass superclass thingies aren't known until runtime

Overloading is compiletime (javac) where the method is appropriately modified to match the signature in one of many ways supported by javac

Also, in one of our use cases, we mentioned that the contact details will be exported to a csv file. Would this also violate the part on specifying UI details?

In our tp project, we allowed for the the desktop to be launched when using address book. However, this caused an issue in Github Actions where it gave a headless exception. 

After doing some googling online, it seemed that the exception arose when the code that is dependent on a keyboard, display, or mouse is called in an environment that does not support a keyboard, display, or mouse. This is especially the case when the workflow is ran on the Ubuntu environment on GitHub Actions.

Do we assume that AddressBook will be used in a system where is it not headless? Because my current solution to resolve this test case issue is to ignore the test case when a headless OS is detected.

**12. :fas-info-circle: 💡Github pages does not render README file correctly**
</div>

As I was trying to set up GIthub Pages for my repo, I came across an issue where the README does not render properly on Github Pages. For example, this was what was produced when setting it up

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b086d4f5-a7f2-45d0-8f24-de4972e39627)

According to [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll), it supports 2 markdown processors, kramdown and Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) 

Sadly for some reason that I do not know why, Github Pages uses kramdown. This can cause some formatting issue when the page is rendered. To solve this, you can follow this guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).

Basically, you need to set up a `_config.yml` file under the `/docs` directory manually and specify the markdown processor
```yml
title: <title>
description: <description>
theme: <theme>
markdown: GFM
```

Even after setting this there are still some format that cannot be rendered properly. For example, 
- Task lists don't work as expected 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35fd8187-2d28-4c5f-b4d7-868d018afc1c)
- Alerts also do not render properly (Image taken from [here](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/27919))
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d67ad07-1a92-4262-a99b-57923112ff19)

Just to share another way of running the bat file on Window: 
1. Open up cmd and navigate to the text-ui-test folder 
2. Enter the file path of runtest.bat

This will run the script and compare the two files without closing the command prompt

Eg. 
Let's say your text-ui-test folder exists at `C:\Users\name\CS2103\ip\text-ui-test`. 
You will run `C:\Users\name\CS2103\ip\text-ui-test\runtest.bat` for step 2

You can choose to not do it and merge it later on after further commits to the same branch/ when the branch/feature is ready for production.

I think the reason for this is that the feature of the branch may not be ready for deployment so you don't merge it first to prevent adding unfinished code to the main branch

To answer this,
"Is it that whenever I commit a change, git is actually tracking/updating the difference between the files inside my working directory and the local repo?"

Git saves the staged files as a new commit in the local repo (.git directory). So yes, I guess it does in a sense "tracks/updates" the differences

A fast forward merge happens when the master branch (or any other branch) have not changed from the branch you are merging to. In this case, git just moves the master branch to the same commit as the merging branch. 

A merge commit happens when both the master branch and merging branch have different unique commits. Instead of just moving the master branch forward to the merging branch, git will "merge" both branches as a new commit. This new commit will have two parent commits, one from each of the branch. 

Here is an image I found online that illustrates this 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7168419-24b3-4bda-a8a0-3904ec7a3641)


I guess the only difference here is that a new commit is made whenever a merge is done for merge commits while fast forward will not have a new commit. 

To my knowledge, this is what happens. Hopefully it answers your question. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

If the function call has side effects like changing the state of another component, we can check if the changed state is equal to our expected outcome.

For instance if you are testing a class and you have a function that changes one of the fields, you can check if the value of the field after calling the function matches the expected value.

The issue most likely arose when you initialised `FileWriter` at the start with override. 

If you are not using `FileWriter(String path, boolean append)`, `FileWriter` will open the file in override mode and thus wipe out all existing data. 

In this case, I guess you have two options
1. Initialize `FileWriter` with the additional boolean argument, `FileWriter(String path, boolean append)`
2. Initialize `FileWriter` when the program is exiting with `FileWriter(String path)`

Hope this solves your issue :)

The reason this happens is because you keep creating a new instance of the scanner every time the loop repeats.

When the first instance of the scanner is created, it takes in an input. When ran without a script, this is the user keyboard input. When ran with a script, this is the input text file provided. 

Thus on every loop iteration, a new instance of the scanner means that the previous input stream gets reset and it awaits for new user/ file input. Since there is no other file supplied, you get the error that you see, "Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found". The program then terminates and gives you the mismatch between your expected and actual files.

To resolve this, you can create your scanner instance outside of the while loop.

My opinion on this issue is that if the static method does not have to work with a shared state/field, then yes it is suitable for it to be static.

If the behavior of the method is predictable with or without an instance of the class, then a static method is more suitable. 

> Consequently, is it okay for me to have a PrintUtils class in a utils package that contains only static methods that are used for outputting message to the user?

I agree with this design as it makes the code more in line with the "Single Responsibility Principle", making it cleaner and easier to understand.

This is just my opinion though, don't take it too seriously 🙃

According to this [online](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-java-io-and-java-nio/) article, nio is an improvement to the current io, hence the name "new io".

The key difference is just how java handles the data. Previously it was handled using streams so data transfer would be synchronous. With nio, data is handled asynchronously and thus more threads are free to do other work. 

Another thing that you mentioned is that it would throw more exceptions and they are also more specific. I guess this is better as you can now catch more errors and exceptions before it gets into production. 

Given a choice, I guess I would just go with nio. (Its newer and more powerfull after all 😆)

Sorry I think you might have misunderstood what I meant or I might have phrased it wrongly. 

What I meant was that if the method produces a behavior/output that is the same and does not change regardless of any changes to instance fields, then I think it can be declared as a static method. 

In this case I do think `showLoadingError` should be declared as static since it prints an error message to the console (I assume) that does not change (stateless) 

Hopefully this is clearer 😄

Your understanding is right. 

Git does a fast forward commit when the master branch is behind the branch of your current branch, branch level 7 when there is no diverging commits in your master branch and your branch level 7. 

A fast forward commit then takes the pointer of the master branch and moves it to the branch level 7 commit and thus they have the same commit hashes.

Though I do think that the course specifies us to use `--no-ff` or disable fast forward commit in all cases even when possible.

I believe @Domokunx is right. I tried running your code locally on my machine but replaced `assertEquals` with this

```java
assertEquals("    Here are the tasks in your list that match book:" +
                "    1.[D][ ] read book (by: Apr 05 2020, 4:00 pm)" +
                "    3.[T][ ] read book", outContent.toString().replaceAll("\n", "").replaceAll("\r", ""));
```

It passed the test case you are looking for.

I do believe the reason for this is because you are calling `Yapper.main`. I am not 100% sure about why, but I think the reason is it launches another program and thus intercepts with the test that is ran by gradle. 

Try removing it and it should run your tests normally. Hopefully this helps :)

Ahh sorry misread the question. 

In this case, you should still define the `fx:controller` to `MainWindow`. As per my understanding, the `fx:controller` is just a bridge that links your java file with the GUI so that the class knows what methods to call.

```java
<fx:root type="AnchorPane" maxHeight="-Infinity" maxWidth="-Infinity"
         minHeight="-Infinity" minWidth="-Infinity"
         prefHeight="600.0" prefWidth="400.0"
         xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17"
         xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" fx:controller="MainWindow">
```

To then run the program, 
```java
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) ``{``
        try ``{``
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"));
           
            // Set the root node
            AnchorPane rootNode = new AnchorPane();
            fxmlLoader.setRoot(rootNode);
            
            // Load the FXML file
            AnchorPane root = fxmlLoader.load();

            // Get the controller and pass the Duke instance
            MainWindow mainWindow = fxmlLoader.getController();
            mainWindow.setDuke(duke);

This means that `fx:root` provides a way to create the Node as the component we specify and then to use that node as its root. Instead of having another instance node to wrap this class the represents it. You can find more details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23600926/how-to-understand-and-use-fxroot-in-javafx) and [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html#root_elements).

I hope this is right, if I did not misinterpret what the question is asking this time 😟

I believe you are using the wrong gradle version as suggested by the error message and the version [here](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.2/userguide/compatibility.html).

I have cloned your repo and changed the gradle version to version 7.6.2 and it is able to run `gradle build` with no issues. 

The file changed is gradle-wrapper.properties in the wrapper directory within the gradle folder 
```
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.2-bin.zip
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
```

Hopefully this solves your issue 😄

Hmm 🤔 Looking at sourcetree, could it be the case that you merged the commit instead of the branch? That could be the reason why the updated gradle version commit were not added when you merged them.

I believe gradle is doing what it needs to as intended, which is to report the exceptions thrown as specified in the build.gradle file. 

To continue inputting commands you can click on the first tab here.

If my understanding is right on how JavaFX works, there is no need to set the root of `MainWindow` since it have been implicitly defined with `AnchorPane` in your `MainWindow.fxml`. Trying to set the root and controller again is why you are getting the error saying that the root value have already been defined.

To resolve this issue, you can simply delete the `MainWindow` constructor. Let me know if this solves your issue 😄

There is probably a version mismatch between your local gradle version and the one specified by the project. `gradlew` uses the gradle wrapper and ensures it builds or runs with the version that was specified in your project.

Hi I tried cloning your master branch repo(hopefully that is the branch you are working on) and made several changes to some of the files. I'm not sure if this would solve the issue for you but it did on my end. 

First I just copied most of my own `build.gradle` file and applied to yours 
```java
plugins ``{``
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
    id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '7.1.2'
``}``

repositories ``{``
    mavenCentral()
``}``


dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.8.1'
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.8.1'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'

    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
``}``

test ``{``
    useJUnitPlatform()

    testLogging ``{``
        events "passed", "skipped", "failed"

        showExceptions true
        exceptionFormat "full"
        showCauses true
        showStackTraces true
        showStandardStreams = false
    ``}``
``}``

application ``{``
    mainClass.set("papadom.Launcher")
``}``

shadowJar ``{``
    archiveBaseName = "papadom"
    archiveClassifier = null
``}``

run``{``
    standardInput = System.in
``}``
```

>[!Note]
> I removed the checkstyle options in the `build.gradle` file for ease of testing. You would probably want to add them back for grading purposes.


I then added a Launcher class at the same level as `papadom` directory 
```java
package papadom;

import javafx.application.Application;

public class Launcher ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Application.launch(PapadomApp.class, args);
    ``}``
``}``
```

I also removed the main method from the `PapadomApp` file
```java
package papadom;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class PapadomApp extends Application ``{``
    public static final int WINDOW_WIDTH = 600;
    public static final int WINDOW_HEIGHT = 400;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) ``{``
        try ``{``
            // Load the FXML file that describes the UI layout
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource("/fxml/MainView.fxml"));

            // Create a scene using the loaded FXML, setting the window size (600x400)
            Scene scene = new Scene(fxmlLoader.load(), WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT);

            // Set the title of the window
            primaryStage.setTitle("Papadom Chatbot");

            // Set the scene (i.e., the window content) and display the window
            primaryStage.setScene(scene);
            primaryStage.show();
        ``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
            Logger.getLogger(PapadomApp.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, "Failed to load FXML", e);
        ``}``
    ``}``

    // The main method launches the JavaFX application
``}``
```
This is how the directory looks

From the screenshot you shared, it seems like the table is entirely missing and there is just a closing `</table>` tag.

On hindsight, I should've included the whole screenshot of the table under the pile of text. But yea I did make sure to close the table with the appropriate tag. I also checked and made sure that there was only one closing tag so I'm not too sure why another closing tag occurred. 

Anyways your suggestion of using pipe characters helped solve the issue. It also made the code look cleaner and less cluttered as compared to using HTML. Thanks for that! 

Do you happen to know why some GFMD elements still cannot be processed like using task lists or alerts? Are there solutions out there for this too? I can't seem to find any.

Is the current master branch your latest code? I tried cloning it and running `gradlew clean build` which resulted in failing test cases.

After further testing, the reason why the test case failed on Github Actions is due to the filePath specified in your test method.

```java
    public void executeDelete_correctInput() ``{``
        TaskList taskList = new TaskList(new ToDo("test"));
        DeleteCommand deleteCommand = new DeleteCommand(0);
        try ``{``
            deleteCommand.execute(taskList, new Ui(), new Storage("data/test.txt"));
        ``}`` catch (TickException e) ``{``
            fail("Exception thrown when it should not have been thrown.");
        ``}``
        assertEquals(0, taskList.getSize());
    ``}``
``}``
```
The build failing previously occurred when I have yet to run the application before calling `gradlew clean build`. After calling `gradlew run`, the file in directory `data/test.txt` gets created and `gradlew build` works properly, passing the test cases.

I reckon Github Action runs a similar procedure internally when building your application. Since the file path `data/test.txt` does not exist on building, the test case is bound to fail and thus the build.

It looks like when the jar file is ran, there is no parent directory and thus the filename returns `null`.

Try removing line 60 and test the jar file. So then the txt file will just be created at the same level as your jar file.

Update: Did not realize in line 59, you had already created a new file. 

In that case, since the file you created `WindeTasks.txt` does not have a path, you need to define the path by calling

```java
file.getAbsoluteFile().getParentFile().mkdirs(); // line 60
```

When I mess up the task file and enter the application again, tasks with invalid save data becomes null on the list(and in some other cases jar file can't be opened any more due to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`). As a result, I can't even close the application either because the code that handles saving feature can't handle null objects properly. Not sure if this is serious or not...But I believe it is better to address situations when the file is corrupted when user opens the application, just like how we did for the CLI version.

Thanks you for the in depth testing. I think you brought up some really good testing points especially the last one with the corrupted file.

I have (hopefully) fixed them in the updated [jar file](https://github.com/Incogdino/ip/releases/tag/v0.2). Thanks a lot!

I believe the resources folder within the jar file is immutable and read-only after the jar file is created. Thus trying to update it itself is already an error.

I would recommend just renaming `hardDisk` to

```java
private static final String hardDisk = "./Nah.txt";
```

This creates a text file relative to your jar file at the root folder.

My wild guess after looking at your `build.gradle` file is that the dependencies for javaFX for windows (and linux) were not included. 

```java
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
```

Try adding these, to your dependencies inside `build.gradle` to support windows and linux.

`java -version` refers to the one that is set in your environment variables, not IntelliJ.

You need to change your environment variables to switch to a different java version. Please refer to [this](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html) faq to see how you can change  your java version.

In my opinion, there is no clear boundaries specified by the equivalence partition for this case (as well as the one for prime numbers and "A", "D", "X"). I think for one to do boundary value analysis, the equivalence partition needs to have a continuous range of values for us to properly define a boundary. 

Perhaps testing "E", "F" and "G" falls under a different name of testing.

I do not see a reason why there should be a cap to the limit on assertions. 

But it seems as though your assertions are calling other methods here. Without knowing too much details of what the methods does, I do not think is very much a good idea. 

For instance, `model.hasLessons(lesson)` should be more like an exception (or a guard clause) rather than an assertion.

Assertions are used to indicate when the programmer screws up and exceptions for when the user or program screws up. In this case, it seem more likely that the assertion happens when the program screws up (bug in code) and should be handled by an exception instead.

Yea I think youre right. Many online posts seem to suggest that it needs to be more than one as well.

> To answer the question, `alt` should be used when there are multiple alternatives while `opt` is used for a single optional path. Using an `alt` with a single frame to represent an optional path goes against the purpose of using diagrams, which is to make it easier for the reader to understand things. So, while both may give the equivalent result, we should use the notation that was intended for the situation.

As provided in the textbook, a red `X` indicate that an object is no longer referenced and deleted (or ready to be garbage collect for Java).

**2. :fas-info-circle: Immunity of Planned Enhancement**
</div>

One of the planned enhancement in the team I tested is improving the error message to be more specific, because currently some command will display the `invalid command format` and the detail for the command format, which is a bit lengthy, they planned to make the error message more specific.

But I found one of the command that allow user to search within a date range, if the range is invalid, such as end date is earlier than begin date, the command fails with error displaying `invalid command format` error. They also did not mention anything about that begin date should be before end date in the UG.

Will this bug reported eligible for `response.Reject` based on the planned enhancement mentioned? As I feel that this is more like failed silently as the command and parameter format is followed, but it fail because the range is invalid.

I am a bit confused how is a bug categorized as `NotInScope`, as the product I tested they allow the contact to have tags, just like AB3. But the product currently do not have a feature to easily add or remove tags, only way is to use `edit` feature, but if there is several existing tag, such as 4 tags or above, the user had to copy down the tag they want to keep and add the new tag if needed, the UG did mention that editing tag is replacing the whole existing tag but the UG doesn't mention anything planned feature that could solve this problem.

How do we categorize these issue as `NotInScope` or `FeatureFlaw` as the team may state that this feature is not important for current iteration but I think this causes some inconvenience to the user.

This command fail because the `studentID` is in wrong format. But the error display is the error message for incorrect format for `detail` command.

But the supposed error message should be telling user that studentID format is inaccurate, we realized that the wrong error message is displayed because we accidentally throw the wrong exception when parsing studentID, the appropriate one should be the throwing `ParseException` with error message that is already provided in the `studentID` class.

**7. :fas-info-circle: User input exceed limitation**
</div>

Link to issue : (https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/issues/306)

This is an issue raised by one of our tester. Our current product has an auto incrementer that assign a studentID to every student added. This is similar to the `Primary_Key` assigned to a data in a database. Hence each and every studentID is unique and won't be reused, even when user is deleted.

Our product is designed for small tuition center, where maximum could handle around hundreds of student. We set the max limit of studentID to be `99999` as a small tuition center is unlikely to exceed the studentID usage, this limitation is allowing a fairly enough safe boundary for user to manage the student contacts. If this ideation of limitation is clearly stated in UG FAQ, could we negotiate on this report? Or is there a more appropriate way to work around?

Besides that, the application will fail silently when the studentID exceed `99999`, can we fix this by displaying the appropriate error message? As this is stated in course website below.

This is an issue raised from PE-D by one of our tester. It has been labeled severity.Medium and type.FeatureFlaw

Our team has some question
Our Product is designed for Singapore local tuition centre management for primary or secondary students.

**Main Question**
Currently our team had limit the input to `Subjects` that are usually offered in tuition centres in Singapore. It is implemented using `enum`. This is to prevent user to input some invalid subjects. We do concern that this might cause some inconvenience as the field is fixed. But we had future plan for implementing these feature for subject management.
- `newSubject`: Allow user to define their own subject that offered in tuition centre
- `delSubject`: Allow user to delete a type of subject

We do not implement this feature on the current iteration as the user input is unpredictable and we can't ensure a subject added is valid. 

Hence, if we included allowing user to define their own subject and manage it in the future, can we define this issue reported as `response.NotInScope`? Based on the criteria stated below at the course website.
<img width="693" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 2 12 49 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac5a715-baf7-4499-959b-73779df7d8ff">

**Side Question**
Another small question we would like to ask are we allow to narrow down the scope of target user now? Like restrict it to be aiming for primary tuition centre only instead of both primary and secondary. Does this violate feature freeze?

Hi prof! Wanted to ask do I need to fix the previous commit message if it violates the git naming convention? As it stated in the textbook that editing might affect the progress tracking. I realize that it is because I did not use capital letter for the first letter in the commit and I commit quite some amount of commit for the past three milestone. Does that affect the gradings?

Hi prof, our team is a bit unsure about how much we need to complete to satisfy the requirement of adding first functionality increment. As each of us is assigned 1 or 2 MVP feature to work on, for this week is it we just need to do some part of the feature increment?

For example: We have new fields for adding new data
So the task we need to do is to
1. add the field
2. do valid check of the field format
3. store and read the field from json format
4. ....

For this week is it that we can pick to do adding the fields as part of the increment and continue to work on it on the upcoming week or we need to do more than that?

Hope my question is clear. Thank you!

**23. :fas-info-circle: Git Branch Merging**
</div>

Previously my JavaDoc branch was floating out of the master branch after commit.
And I think this may cause my branch not detected by the bot as this the only branch that is marked red in the iP progress.
<img width="519" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 9 39 36 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706e63ff-22af-472d-b0a0-39cd5407fc08">

I spent some time solving it, and tried to turn off the fast-forwarding in Source Tree after reading this forum #131 
After some tries, now there is no more floating branches, but there is quite a lot of parallel branch created.
<img width="816" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10 10 09 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a541e06b-5d2a-42c0-9a3a-79a7fa3f7e67">

May I ask
1. Is the fast forwarding the reason causing the JavaDoc branch to be floating without merging back? Or is it cause by other problem (Not merging branch correctly, etc)
2. How to correctly merge branch to avoid creating a lot of parallel branch like the second screenshot?

Hope my question is clear :D

I had read the site [](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html#commit-message-body) about Git Convention for commit message.

In the website they mentioned like this
"Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you think you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it. We don't check the code to see if you have actually done the said increment. Therefore, it is just a mechanism for you to self-declare progress and for us to monitor those progress declarations."

So I think it doesn't not affect much if your initial tag is at the commit that meet the requirement stated in the website for the particular level. I think there is no harm by moving the tag to your latest update, but it could better to remove the previous one so you won't end up with several tag if you have multiple updates/revisions. Or maybe could go with Level-1.1, Level-1.2 tags. This just from my understanding of the usage of tags from the 2103 website and other resources, hopefully my opinion is helpful :)

For me I don't actually has method that print out different command error, I had a parent class for Exception (`ToothlessException`) and some inherited class that represent different type of error such as `MissingIndexException`, `MissingDescriptionException` and etc. Each has used the `super(String errorMessage)` in their own constructor to pass the error message to be printed. And I used `try` `catch` in my `main()` method to print the message from the exception via `e.getMessage()`. Not sure is this the best way to do it but it reduce the need to create lots of methods in the `Ui` class to print the messages. Hope it will helps!

Hi I just downloaded your chatbot. I am using Mac aIso and I briefly tested the program and it runs well!
Good to see you have design your own GUI, you also added different color to the dialog box when command like `delete`, `mark`, `unmark` is entered. A red dialog box is also shown when there is error in the command entered bu the user, well done! Seen you also implemented a `help` command that guide the user how to use the chatbot in the app, this is a good guide for new users! Overall I haven't test out an error on the chatbot. Good job!

Here is some screenshot from my testing:

# Use of AI Tools in the Project
(This is from my iP AI.md file)
## Introduction

Several AI tools are used in the development of the project (Toothless Chatbot). The AI tools employed in this project are ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot. These AI tools have enhanced the coding workflow, improved productivity, and raised quality standards in the project.

## AI Tools Used

### 1. ChatGPT and Claude

These two AI tools are primarily used to enhance written communication, code explanation, and problem-solving for the project.

#### Applications

- **Improving Documentation**: These AI tools are mainly used as writing assistants to refine user guides, README files, and PR descriptions.
- **Enhancing Code-Related Communication**: They are also used to improve grammar and clarity in PR descriptions and aid in generating informative and standardized commit messages.
- **Problem Solving and Ideation**: The tools are used to aid in brainstorming feature ideas and implementation strategies. Sometimes they are used to suggest alternative approaches to enhance feature functionalities.

#### Things to Note When Using ChatGPT and Claude
- **Review and Refinement**: Always review and refine the generated content to ensure accuracy and relevance to the project. As sometime the review given might be irrelevant to the project or out of the context of the project.
- **Use in Specific Contexts**: Use these tools in specific contexts where they can provide the most value, such as documentation, communication, and ideation. Try to give the prompt in such a way that the AI can understand the context of the project, so they can give more accurate suggestions.
- **Avoid Over-Reliance**: Avoid over-reliance on AI-generated content and ensure that the final output aligns with the project's goals and requirements. As the AI can give suggestions but the developer should been the one to give ideation and make the final decisions.

### 2. GitHub Copilot

Copilot is mainly used as a real-time coding assistant to enhance the productivity of the project.

#### Applications

- **Code Generation**: It is used to suggest complete functions based on comments or function names. It suggests boilerplate code for common patterns. It also aids in autocompleting repetitive structures such as loop constructs and error handling.
- **API and Library Usage**: It also suggests library functions and methods to be used to create project features. It can also aid in autocompleting import statements for required modules.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Copilot also aids in error handling by providing quick fixes for common errors like syntax errors. It can also be used to aid in debugging by suggesting possible causes of bugs or errors.
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: It provides relevant code snippets based on the surrounding code context and suggests variable names that align with existing naming patterns.
- **Documentation**: It also aids in completing documentation such as writing header comments for classes and functions.

#### Things to Note When Using GitHub Copilot
- **Code Review and Refinement**: Always review and refine the code generated by Copilot to ensure correctness and alignment with project standards as sometime Copilot can give suggestions that are not relevant to the project.
- **Use in Specific Contexts**: Utilize Copilot in specific contexts where it can provide the most value, such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. These can let Copilot to give more detailed and accurate suggestions.
- **Avoid Over Reliance**: Avoid over-reliance on Copilot-generated code to avoid substituting fundamental coding skills with AI assistance. Always ensure that the code align with the project requirement and understand how the code works. 

## Benefits of AI Integration in the Project

1. **Efficiency**: Using these tools significantly reduces time spent on routine coding tasks, documentation, and problem-solving.
2. **Learning and Skill Development**: Accelerates learning of new concepts and coding skills when the tools are used appropriately.
3. **Communication**: Enhances the clarity and effectiveness of code-related communications.
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Handles low-level details and allows developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving.

## Things to Note When Using AI Tools in Development of the Project

1. **Critical Review**: Always review and understand AI-generated content before incorporation, as it may not always be correct or suitable for use. Reviewing and understanding the content also helps avoid over-reliance on AI for coding, which may hinder developers from gaining knowledge through the project.
2. **Use it as Augmentation, Not Replacement**: Use AI to enhance the project development but not as a substitute for fundamental coding skills.
3. **Balance of using AI and Human Skills**: Ensure to maintain a balance between AI assistance and human creativity to preserve the project's unique aspects and learning purpose in building the project.

## Conclusion

The integration of ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot has significantly enhanced my iP development process, especially in improving code quality, documentation, and overall productivity.

I think the problem that the `## Guide` is having an extra whitespace before the `##` as shown below (highlighted part). By removing it should render the markdown correctly.

### Some Suggestions
Besides here are some suggestion for the GFMD for your UG

1. Format can be shown in inline code

---

3. Consider setting first characters of word in headings as capital letters
<img width="383" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 2 15 30 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73712728-fceb-4455-b810-ca3406790591">

---

4. Bold the first line or important keywords of the paragraph instead of the whole paragraph
<img width="413" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 2 15 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a086c579-c4ba-4df1-bbfc-00b8eb89e475">

Thank you prof for clarifying, the naming for the new release can be anything? like `v0.3` or should i replace the `v0.2` release and retag it?

From my opinion, I feel like the first diagram is more concise and easier to read, as the both of the conditions has to be true to execute the intended behavior. while if one of it is false, it will skip the execution of the behavior. It seems a bit redundant to include another branch node as it doesn't result in a different branch/behaviour if valid argument is true and boolean check is false. Hence, I think there is not necessary to have another branch node to indicate the second condition check. But  actually diagram 2 might also create a bit of ambiguity in the second diagram, which will be explain below

For the second question, I am concerning that is there ambiguous for reader as now it is in a separated branch, reader might be confused as they not sure what is the expected value for `booleanChecked` now, as it can be understand as
1. `booleanChecked` supposed to `true` to process the intended behavior, then `!booleanChecked` which is `false` will be branched out (As what is shown in diagram 1)
2. `booleanChecked` supposed to be `false` to process the intended behavior, then `!booleanChecked` will be `true` and branch out (This is different from what the diagram 1 is representing now)

Hence, maybe `booleanChecked == true` will be more clear? But not sure is writing `[booleanChecked]` a more concise representation for it.

Not sure is my understanding on the right track, correct me if I am wrong : D

narrowing down will require code changes for narrowing down the limitation check for `yearGroup` and `subject` allowed in the app. So from my understanding this is not allowed?

If narrowing down is not allowed in this case, seems like catering subset of target market would be a better work around for us.

Not sure am I correct, `alternative path` might require at least `two` path for the code to execute, but in this case there is only one, hence there is no alternative path provided. But this is not mentioned in the slide before so I am not so certain about it too. Maybe prof can clarify better.

Sound reasonable to me too! Maybe prof can consider adding this detail to the website notes. I believe it help in making the difference of `opt` and `alt`

Same insight with @Incogdino , the multiplicity of `1` between `Table` and `Door` means that if there is a `Table` object, it must be associated with one and only one `Door` object. Since the object diagram is not having any `Door` instances connecting to `Table`, it doesn't match the multiplicity stated. Hence not a valid match.

What would the if else block look like in a sequence diagram? I have tried drawing it (attaching my attempt below), but I'm not sure when the activation bar of the generate method should break, since there are two cases in which it can be executed. Technically, it should break when the method returns, but if I break at when getTask() returns, wouldn't the activation bar for the [else] condition be incorrect?

Hello, for this question, I get why CCDs are more suitable than class diagrams for domain modelling. But I don't understand why sequence diagram is a suitable tool for domain modelling? Since from my understanding, sequence diagrams involve the more technical aspects, like method calls between objects and classes, and they model the logic of the program, and thus I would think that it is less suitable for domain modelling than class diagrams?

For this question, why is the direction of navigability from a1 and a2 to u instead of the other way around? Is the direction from Activity to UiWidget because of how the question is phrased?

**7. :fas-info-circle: Practice test Part 1 Question [p1.12] implementation: refactoring**

Hello, may I ask for practice test part 1 question 12, 

1. Per the definition of refactoring from textbook, it says 'without modifying the **external** behaviour'. In this case why is option 4 not a refactoring? The answer says because it changes the behaviour, but I thought that adding an exception does not change the external behaviour (i.e. my understanding is the behaviour displayed to the user), but it does change the internal behaviour of the code since it now catches a new exception? 

2. Why is 5 a valid refactoring? My rationale in choosing option 5 was because it violates coding standard by removing the braces around the if block and thus is not "improving the internal structure" as per the definition of refactoring.

And secondly, do the multiple response questions have partial marks or we'll only get the marks if we select all the correct options. 

Thank you.

**9. :fas-info-circle: Slow search result for keywords such as n-tier client-server architectural style**
</div>

I am using Adobe acrobat reader and have downloaded the latest textbook reference from canvas. I noticed that when I'm searching for keywords such as 'n-tier' or 'client-server architectural style', it takes very long to load the results (more than 3 minutes, and I cancelled the search after so I'm not sure how long it actually takes). But this does not happen if I search for other keywords such as 'sequence diagrams'. May I ask if there are ways I can mitigate this issue so that the search is more efficient when taking the final exam?

**10. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on the return types of overloaded and overridden methods**
</div>

Hi, I'm a bit confused by the descriptions of overloading and overriding in the textbook. In one section, it says that overloaded methods have the same name but different type signatures (but return type is not part of the type signature). Then in another section, it says overloaded methods can have possibly different return types.

On the other hand, for overridden methods, one section says it has the same or a subtype of the original return type, but the other section says overridden methods have the same return types.

**11. :fas-info-circle: Are not in scope reports counted towards accuracy bonus marks?**

Hello, can I check for the bonus marks, are bug reports marked as Response.NotInScope by the dev team considered "accepted as reported", and thus count towards the bonus marks? Or is this only referring to bugs that are explicitly accepted by the dev team?

**12. :fas-info-circle: Can the dev team mark bugs that are known bugs as not in scope?**
</div>

Hi, in the textbook, it says that listing bugs as known bugs in the UG will not exempt those bugs from the final grading. That is, PE testers can still earn credit for reporting those bugs and the **dev team will still be penalized** for them. So if I have reported a bug that they mentioned under known bugs, can the dev team mark it as not in scope? Since this will contradict with what was mentioned for `response.NotInScope` - the **dev team will not be penalized**, but the bug reporter will earn a small amount of credit for reporting it. Would like to clarify on this matter, since I followed the textbook (screenshot given below) when deciding which bugs to send and which to keep, and sent this bug report with the belief that I can still receive credit for it despite it being listed as a known bug, but the team has marked it as not in scope, which will reduce the credits I receive. Therefore I want to check whether I should rebut their not in scope remark.

**13. :fas-info-circle: Missing team size and naming convention**
</div>

Hi, in the textbook, it says to state the team size under the section of planned enhancement so that the tester can know whether the count exceeds the allowed number. If the team does not state the team count, is this a documentation bug? Since it is only applicable in this course to aid testing. 
<img width="826" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-16 at 11 06 35 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b44cb08-0faf-48de-8d70-e0f5a1d88dfa">

Secondly, if the team names the sections differently, e.g. known problems / known bugs instead of known issues, or future plans / future enhancements instead of planned enhancements can I assume that they are each referring to the known issues and planned enhancement section as per the textbook, and apply the same rules? (i.e. bugs in known issues do not have immunity but bugs in planned enhancements do)

For other fields that are short, I can put them again in the UG.

I don't think the reviewer will be able to copy this emoji when they fill out the review form for me. Since you can't select and copy on the chatbot interface itself. As such, would I be penalised because my error message is different if my peer reviewer is unable to input the emoji part of the message, which result in a difference between the expected output and the actual output?

> I believe the program starts checking from your root folder (should be the "ip" folder). So it's possible that some other part of your code is creating a test.txt file in that folder.

Hi @Domokunx, just to clarify, why might another part of the code create a test.txt file when I specified for FileWriter to open the one I created inside the java directory? Upon checking, I actually see another test.txt file being created inside the ip folder but outside the java folder. And this one contains the hello world line. How should I adjust the file path to make the program write to the specific test.txt file that I created? Thanks!

Hi, does that mean it's better to use relative paths like ./java/test.txt? But when I tried doing that, the program searches from the top of the repo from ip downwards and instead of accessing the test.txt file in the current directory, it creates a new file in the ip directory.

Hi Prof @damithc, in this case, if the response from the dev team was just something along the lines of "this issue was listed under known bugs" without justifying why they think it is not important enough to be done in the current version, can I reject the response not in scope remark? Further, I do think that this is a feature flaw that is important to implement since it is an issue on not allowing special characters in names when names are expected to match legal names that may have special characters in it.

Hi Prof @damithc, in this case, if I disagree with the dev team's response because I disagree that the bug is response.NotInScope or I don't think it is a duplication, but later on the teaching team decided that the response.NotInScope is valid, will this negatively affect the accuracy bonus? The severity of the issue is not affected at all (i.e. the dev team agreed with my severity chosen), just that I disagree with the response.NotInScope tag so I'm wondering if I should raise this up in case it might negatively affect the accuracy marks as opposed to just accepting it since the severity is correct.

@emmannyyy Thanks for your answer! Part 1 makes sense now. 

But for part 2, I don't quite get how removing the braces around the if block improves the code, since according to the coding standard, you should not remove the braces even if there is only one statement. Or is improving the code independent from the coding standard?

If I'm understanding this correctly, it seems like you can give any name to an object, as it is only helping with your own understanding of which object that is when differentiating between objects. But please correct me if I'm wrong.

@FYL2003 Can I ask why did you draw the multiplicity between handout and brochure as 1---*? I also did * as @Incogdino drew, since in the question it stated "A Handout can be referenced by the text in **any** number of Brochures.". 

Secondly, Prof @damithc, can we assume the multiplicity of a regular attribute stored in a class to be 0...1? e.g. the `closest` association in this case. As it does not seem to be mentioned in the question, and there is no default multiplicity. So I was unsure of whether we can assume, or it is better to leave it empty.

Lastly, for the object diagram in part b, since the only explicit condition mentioned was the heading is "Intro", but because the other attributes had default values i.e. 0 and false, would it be wrong to only show the heading attribute?

Hi Prof @damithc, in this case, an alt frame works since there is a break statement in the switch cases which means it won't fall-through to the following switch cases. But what happens if there is no break statement in the switch case? In that case alt won't work since multiple partitions may be executed.

> > I was wondering whether a branch node can act as a merge node and vice versa. Since after the branch node ([less than 3 tries]), the next node it encounters is actually a branch node ([all positive]/[else]). Or does the [less than 3 times] path ends at the `user places hand on reader` action (just that the merge node wasn't shown) ?
> 
> @LemonDrew Easier to decide if you post the alternative proposed diagram :-)

@LemonDrew Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe you are referring to whether there should be an additional diamond shaped node in the diagram? Since each branch node should have a merge node to indicate the end of the alternative paths, which implies that there should be an even number of the diamond shaped nodes as for each set of alternative paths there should be a branch and a merge node. Since in the diagram, there are only three diamond shaped nodes, is there a missing merge node or can a diamond shaped node act as both branch and merge nodes **at the same time**? 

Here's my take: 
I think the only merge node here is the one at the bottom which has two inputs coming into it (since it is merging two alternative paths). I don't think the [less than 3 times] path ends at the user places hand on reader action, instead it also ends at the merge node at the bottom, because [less than 3] -&gt; (place hand again) -&gt; p1, p2, p3 ... are part of the path as well. Initially, I thought that each branch node should have a corresponding merge node, but after referring back to the textbook this was not mentioned, hence it could be the case that multiple branch nodes can share the same merge node. Perhaps Prof @damithc can comment on this? 

And also, is the activity "user asked to place hand again" needed? Or can we bypass it, and directly connect the arrow to the "user places hand on reader" activity?

**For abstract class:** concrete subclasses will need to implement any abstract methods in the parent class. But for non abstract methods I think it works as per normal inheritance, i.e. the subclass will inherit the methods directly from the abstract parent class
**For interfaces:** yes, subclasses need to implement all the methods in the interface

**4. :fas-info-circle: 💡Using Checkstyle with the agreed convention for the arrow-hand switch case notation.**
</div>

As mentioned in #49, the preferred switch case convention with the arrow-hand notation is as such:
```Java
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; 
```

However, this goes against the indentation rule where cases are supposed to be indented by `0`. 
If the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is attempted to be used, the script still flags for this build mistake.

Instead, use the inbuilt SuppressionCommentFilter:
```Java
<module name="SuppressionCommentFilter">
            <property name="offCommentFormat" value="CHECKSTYLE.OFF\: ([\w\|]+)"/>
            <property name="onCommentFormat" value="CHECKSTYLE.ON\: ([\w\|]+)"/>
            <property name="checkFormat" value="$1"/>
        </module>
```

and add the comments above and below: for example:

```Java
// CHECKSTYLE.OFF: Indentation
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; 
// CHECKSTYLE.ON: Indentation
```

which will disable the Indentation rule for the area between the two comments.

> Note: only use this if you're sure that your code matches the convention. In this scenario, a new Checkstyle custom rule is required since it does not recognise the arrow-notation, so this is a less taxing way of building without flagging the Checkstyle.

(without an assignment)
```Java
switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
case 'T' -&gt; functionT();
case 'E' -&gt; functionE();
case 'D' -&gt; functionD();

Hi. I didn't use IntelliJ to run the .sh file, and instead used the terminal! Upon checking my IntelliJ however, my interpreter options are just BASH - options: `BASH`, path: `/usr/bin/env`.

Ah. That's my bad then.

If you're using Windows, that means you most likely don't have BASH installed. There are two ways you can test now:

1. The easier way (at least, in my opinion): Using the .bat file
The .sh file requires a Unix shell - (Windows terminal is DOS) - so using a [.bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) file would be easier, as it runs natively on Windows.

2. Using the .sh file
There are a lot of ways to access BASH in Windows - one way would be to use [Git's BASH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26522789/how-to-run-sh-on-windows-command-prompt) since that should be installed, or install another tool, or another (long-winded way, but you might find it useful for later) is to install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and move your programming environment there (which you might find helpful in the future.)

@damithc Interesting. Thanks.

In my opinion, I feel both styles should be allowed. Particularly, I personally feel the shorthand notation is extremely readable when the switch case is responsible for calculating a value for a certain variable.
 The `case` indentation should remain the same regardless.

Personally, I find that the following format is the most readable (using @michaelyql's example), where the switch case follows right after, with everything inside the code block having an extra indent (because it's technically a continuation of the statement above).
Having the case being at the exact same indentation as the actual `switch` statement will cause issues with too much characters per line if the variable being assigned has a long name for example.

```java
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``;
```

Would like to hear input on this as well!

If `javac` is not recognised, that generally means either Java is not installed (highly unlikely since you should have used it to run this) or it's not in your PATH.

Here's [Oracle's documentation on setting JAVA_HOME](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html). If you're not sure where your Java installation is, you can go into your Project Structure in IntelliJ, and look at Platform Settings > look at your installation and see your JDK home path there.

It seems that you have found a workaround - but may I recommend that you check your `$JAVA_HOME` PATH variable? If your terminal is using Java19, there's a chance your current `$JAVA_HOME` points to that particular version of Java instead of the one you have to use, and it might be beneficial to change that for the rest of the module, at the very least.

According to the video, that relationship refers to the tracking of the longest `Route` by `Logic`. In that sense, it means that `Logic` might not be tracking any `Route`  when there are no routes, meaning that `Logic` is linked to 0 `Route`, and when there is at least one route, it will be associated to 1 `Route`.

Similarly on the other way round, each `Route` can only be the longest for 1 `Logic` or not the longest for any, hence the similar multiplicity.

In your dependencies, you have it misspelled: ```testImplementation group: 'org.junitm.jupiter'```.
```testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'``` is the right name.

Thus, your Gradle is unable to fetch the dependency from the repository. This should work.

In addition to what the above have said, there's also these `&hat;M` characters in your code - which I don't think SHOULD appear - they're the carriage return (for new lines).

> which would mean.. i need to finalise a working copy and push on 1 workstation before moving on the another workstation (pulling)?

Yep, hence why it is generally just better to have a local copy on both machines and push everytime you want to move to the other machine. The convenience of syncing ala-GDrive/OneDrive may be lost, but you're a lot more likely to not run into unexpected behaviour. (for example, editing on one side, then editing on the other PC and the syncing causing some conflict within the changed file).

Git also has some behaviour that isn't seen sometimes when you do push which is helpful for maintaining code across different OSes - `core.autocrlf` for example is a Git setting that helps manage line separators (that differ in Mac and Windows)

Works fine for me (tested on Windows). Seems to be a problem unrelated to Java, but CapsLock input? 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdREmCHrnYw) illustrates a similar problem. Seems like a Mac issue?

Could you try double-clicking on it with your CapsLock off?

You probably need to reformat your code. Right click on your `src` folder and reformat the code for the line separators to update!

Interesting. I downloaded one of your files, and it still only shows the Carriage Return (/r), and not the (/n) as expected.

When you reformatted, did you tick YES on the `do not keep line breaks`? If you didn't, please try that? [IntelliJ's documentation on reformatting code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html#reformat_file)

Personally, I like to think of getting the value of a `boolean` variable as a check for true or false. For example, if `isComplete` indicates if a task is complete, `checkIsComplete` indicates that the method checks if the task is complete.

With regards to this comment, I think the coding standard with regards to boolean methods refers to a "question word" prefix. While setting up the linter for my project, I turned on the `Boolean method names must start with question word` filter (under `Editor > Inspections` in IntelliJ) - clicking onto it gives a list of question words, that are generally good to go - and this has allowed me to come up with the prefixes for my boolean method/variables.

Hmm, apparently that dialog is only for reformatting code.

However, I've found something else:

In your settings, under Editor > Code Style > Java > Wrapping and Braces,
turn off reformatting at line breaks (the first checkbox in the image below)

<img width="370" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ac99392-5489-404a-b759-44eae94f879a">.

Unfortunately, it seems like there's no way to change existing files in IntelliJ (at least from my research so far - if someone has a solution).

You probably have to find some way of converting all the CRs to CRLF or LF - obviously there are manual solutions - but perhaps this might be the best.

Assuming you're on Mac, open your terminal and use `mac2unix` to convert the files.

The command is `mac2unix FILE` - try it on one file, commit and see if it works on Github, then if it does, you can do it for the rest of the files!

(if you are doing this, for consistency, set your line separator settings to /n (Linux and Unix) so that your new files follow this setting!).

Agreed with my favourite homie above @RadieonAjax, but perhaps a benefit that could be had by having it as a constant is if you can put all your constants with regards to UI messages together, you can easily change them in the future, since all of them are in one place, and it's easy to find where the message is.

I think the first one is just way more readable. If the specified path can only occur together given the two conditions, it is much simpler to just state them as such.

A real world analogy for me would be - if you want to only give someone money if they have done two surveys, would you check for one survey at a time, or would you just check both surveys in one shot? 

The only reason to provide an alternative path would be if there's an action happening somewhere.

I assume you're trying to sort your `Person` through the name, hence the comparing of names. 

I know this isn't what you're looking for specifically, but would it not be easier, in that sense, to implement `Comparable` and thus use the `compareTo` method for whatever purpose you need?

--

Also, would SRP be broken for `Person` in this scenario? Would the addition of the method be considered an additional responsibility - it's not necessarily implementing the `compareTo` itself, but instead grabbing the result of the `Name` comparison. I would argue it would be part of the responsibility of the `Person` class - which is to model the data and behaviour of a person.

> Must an alt path have >1 frames always 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/994fa79f-47f1-47d0-9e8a-feaeed7c2b9e)

Hmm, interestingly, if I'm reading this right, the UML specification states that there only needs to have 1 frame minimum, and does not state anywhere differently. (Credit to: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21939324/difference-between-alt-and-opt-fragment-in-sequence-diagram))

At the same time -

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6206243-28e8-4e04-9de9-c9b56b3c88c4)

the optional path mentions that it is semantically equivalent to an alternate with 2 options having the second be empty, implying that a second operand must exist for a alternate path, but there is no firm writing everywhere that an alternate path must have >1 operands. @Tkaixiang 

---

To answer @SeeYangZhi's question, the issue lies with the word 'appropriate' IMO. 

It would be appropriate for us to write the following code based on the sequence diagram. 
However, would it be appropriate for us to draw the diagram based on the code? If appropriateness specifically talks about interpretation instead of actual rules, I think it would not be appropriate to draw it as an alternate path instead of an optional path.

The diagram should indicate what is happening in the code, and it would be misleading (IMO) to indicate it as an alternative path when there is no alternative.

Would appreciate a clarification from you prof! @damithc

I think you're missing out the underline for the class-level method `capacity` in `Section`.

I also believe the access modifiers in `Handout` are wrong? `isFull` should be `#` (protected), and I think by default since there's no declared modifier `heading` is `~` (package-private)

For the `Handout` to `Brochure` and `Sections`, I think the aggregation symbol can be used? Since it's a list of `Brochure` and `Sections`.

Hmm, with regards to the first question, don't we already indicate `~` (package-private) visibility for all methods/fields without explicit access modifiers? Going by that logic, we should be indicating that the methods are all by default `abstract` and `public` for interfaces.

**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡Common debugging issues when setting up javafx to individual project.**
</div>

This is a non exhaustive list of issues I faced while setting up javafx to project:

1. I forgot to add javafx.fxml to the javafx inside of build.gradle like below so they couldn't really recognise fxml files at first. The corrected version is:

```groovy
javafx ``{``
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml']
``}``
```

2. in the MainWindow.fxml file I never write the controller class path properly. The corrected version is:

```fxml
<AnchorPane maxHeight="-Infinity"
            maxWidth="-Infinity"
            minHeight="-Infinity"
            minWidth="-Infinity"
            prefHeight="600.0"
            prefWidth="400.0"
            stylesheets="@../css/main.css"
            xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17.0.7"
            xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1"
            fx:controller="mortalreminder.io.MortalReminderWindow">
```

3. Make sure to only use .png files for pictures.

4. Make sure to use the correct name/path for the image file in the MainWindow folder

5. Never change the mainClass to the appropriate one after adding the Launcher file. Corrected version:

```groovy
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("mortalreminder.io.Launcher")
``}``
```

6. After using scene builder, I didn't change the version of javafx being used to match the system. To fix I looked for:

```groovy
xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17.0.7"
```

inside the .fxml files and changed it to 17.0.7 (used to be like 22 or something)

For number 1: I think you can refer to the website they have specified in the standards/conventions page of the website. This is the [link](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html).

For number 2, I’m not too sure but from the website they did say you can just put a few levels together so I think it should be fine if it’s not in order? However, it would be pretty weird if ur level 1 is 3 commits ahead of ur level 3, so i think as long as its not to that extent it should be fine.

I would extend this by creating a formatted printer class and have every method as a static method to standardise all the output lines like below:

Static Method 1: formattedPrinter(string)
``{``
String indent;
String separatorLine;
[add any other formatting here]
formats any message to a consistent output format and prints it using the method shared above
``}``

Static Method 2: onwards would just be things like:
markingTaskMessage(task)
``{``
string message = “enter ur message for marking a task here”;
formattedPrinter(message)
``}``

This allows u to control all ur prints from one class and standardise format without falling into cyclical dependencies later on (since this class will not make any internal references to any other classes). You can also call these methods without instantiating because all the methods will be static making the rest of the code look cleaner (as there is no random long print lines).

I have managed to fix the issue. I realised that the program I had, only supported checks to see if a file "listStorage.txt" exists or not, not the entire directory that it belongs in. Once I implemented a check to see if the "text-files" and its parent directory exists and create if it does not, both runtest.sh and runtest.bat files were able to run smoothly with no errors.

this was the block of code I added into my load function which helped to solve the issue:

```
File f = new File(storageListFilePath);

// Check if the file/folder already exists and create if it is not,
// send a warning if unable to create either and the file still does not exist
if ((!f.getParentFile().mkdirs() || !f.createNewFile()) && !f.exists()) ``{``
    FormattedPrinting.fileCorrupted();
``}``

Currently I am using Sourcetree to do the tagging and once I tag a commit, the commit tag does not move about unless I intentionally move them. New tags added also do not get added to my older commits. I would recommend using Sourcetree as mentioned in the course as I feel that it is closer to the command line (in that you can control things more specifically).

As you can see from this image the tags are stationary and do not change:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd76667f-5afa-4e31-9735-2a9b2106d053)

i suspect it has to do with the way the git GUI on intellij shows the tags on each branch (maybe all the tags found on a future commit of a particular branch will be shown for all older commits).

You can double check using sourcetree accordingly.

Personally while I do think it may be a little slower than normal, I would just do a refresh (rewrite everything on the file from scratch) every time I mark/unmark or delete things from the app. While there are concerns, like it’s slower than other methods, at this stage, I hardly think there’s going to be much lag especially cause in a reminder app such as this, the list would not run into the millions (which seems impractical), at which point only, it would take a very long time to load and unload.

Another benefit of running a refresh would be, catching any corrupted files in between, should the file be tampered with while the app is open.

Moreover, it makes the implementation a lot easier saving you a lot of development time.

Thus, I feel while this may not be the best approach for a different app, for the reasons above I think it would be a good way to implement in this type of app.

Hi I’m not sure if I’m doing it wrongly but I allowed my main class be the one just simply take inputs and throw it into the parser which then parsed the input into a command. Then I had another class, processor, which processed said inputs. My Ui class was named “formatted printer” and handled only the printing of outputs to user.

So my structure was like

Input from main -&gt; turns into a recognisable command inside of parser -&gt; the command is acted on by a processor -&gt; the resulting feedback is then printed by the UI class

Similar to the above person I used enums for my commands as well.

I wouldn’t necessarily test this method (as with any method that merely prints stuff) as it seems very trivial. I would rather test the method that may cause this method to be called on, which in this case should be something like `loadTasks()`.

In the testing for the `loadTasks()` method, I would add a test putting in a corrupted file or write some gibberish to the file first before calling `loadTasks()` on it to see if the error is handled correctly. This should let you know if it’s working as intended.

I did a few methods’ Javadocs on my own for practice and then used chatgpt to generate the rest of the docs after that. I think it should be fine but do note the Java doc generated isn’t always accurate and you should still do some corrections whenever possible.

I realised in the expected text file, they seem to trim the trailing spaces when u save the file. One way to fix this would be to format the code for ur printing method and remove any spaces before the line break

```java
public void formatPrint(String string) ``{``
    System.out.println(string + “\n”);
``}``
```

Instead of 

```java
public void formatPrint(String string) ``{``
    System.out.println(string + “ \n”);
``}``
```

@damithc hi prof, i think the scenebuilder part of tutorial 4 could have been improved because I noticed when scenebuilder modifies your .fxml file, the javafx version is changed to like 22 which causes a warning to flash every time you run the app and pass in a command.

Hi just a disclaimer, I have no official info, but going according to what I have seen in the lecture notes and examples so far, I think magic numbers should be fine as long as it’s within a very small scope say a short method. For a bigger method, I still don’t think it’s a code violation but I would still name it cause I forget what I’m doing with that number quite often 😂.

## CLI-App

I had a dedicated printing class at first when I was still working on the CLI-App. The excerpt below is of my printer class from then:

``` java
public class FormattedPrinting ``{``

    public static void formatPrint(String message) ``{``
        String indentation = "   ";
        String separatorLine = indentation + "______________________________________________________";
        StringBuilder outputMessage = new StringBuilder(separatorLine);
        String[] messageLines = message.split("\n");
        for (String line : messageLines) ``{``
            outputMessage.append("\n")
                    .append(indentation)
                    .append(line);
        ``}``
        outputMessage.append("\n")
                .append(separatorLine);
        System.out.println(outputMessage.toString());
    ``}``

    public static void welcome() ``{``
        String welcomeMessage = "Hello I'm Mortal Reminder!\n"
                + "What can I do for you?";
        formatPrint(welcomeMessage);

    ``}``
``}``
```


The first method allowed all of my print classes to have a consistent format in the printing styles. This class also mostly consisted of static methods (as seen in the second method) which could be called from other classes without instantiating an object of said class.

## GUI-App
Later on, specifically after I moved to GUI-App, I realised this method was kind of becoming redundant as the GUI basically handled all of the formatting for me. As such, I incorporated an error class which then helped to pass in any error messages. An excerpt is shown below:

``` java
/**
     * Retrieves the task at the specified index from the list.
     * <p>
     * If the index is out of bounds or the list is empty, an appropriate message is printed
     * and ``{``@code null``}`` is returned.
     *
     * @param index the index of the task to retrieve.
     * @return the ``{``@link Task``}`` at the specified index, or ``{``@code null``}`` if the index is invalid.
     * @throws MortalReminderException if the index is invalid in the list.
     */
    public Task getTask(int index) throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        try ``{``
            return this.taskList.get(index);
        ``}`` catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) ``{``
            if (this.getSize() == 0) ``{``
                throw new MortalReminderException("List is empty!");
            ``}``
            throw new MortalReminderException("Invalid task number!\n"
                    + "Please input a number between 1 and "
                    + this.getSize());
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

In spirit of laziness and not wanting to re-code everything, I changed return type in the printer class to strings. I kept the first method of the printer class as the following:

``` java
/**
     * Prints out the formatted output of the chatbot to the user.
     * An indentation is added to each line and the separator lines are added at the top and bottom of each
     * line in the message.
     *
     * @param message output message from chatbot to be printed out to the user
     * @return a version of confirmation message with specific modifications.
     */
    public static String getResponse(String message) ``{``
        return message;
    ``}``
```

and to make it "useful" maybe when I am done with this weeks tasks add a list of "personality quirks" which i can add at random to the start of each output message.

## How were these errors printed?
Basically, I had the main class in my project to do a try catch block like so:

``` java
/**
     * Initialises the execution of a command and returns the feedback message from the processor.
     *
     * @param command command created using the parser.
     * @return the string response from the chatbot after command has been executed.
     */
    public String executeCommand(Command command) ``{``
        try ``{``
            return processor.handleCommand(command, taskList);
        ``}`` catch (MortalReminderException e) ``{``
            return e.getMessage();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

I think assert is used as a safeguard in future development. If the code logic for other methods above the code are changed and the assumption is broken, you will immediately know and change the code accordingly if you had not accounted for it previously.

In terms of error vs assert, in this case the code could still work but the assumption could have become invalid.

An example could be like your delete function. It could assume the add method has already checked if the task is valid or not. However later if you add a second adding method without the check for other purposes (loading a task from file) this could be invalid in SOME cases and not all. So the code could still work but the assumption will be invalid so you would then need to account for it.

@damithc hi prof, regarding this:

> Is this needed? I don't think we mention this in the JavaFX tutorial, and we don't have it in AB3 either.

I was having issues running the app without the javafx.fxml because gradle was not recognising the .fxml files for some reason. After I added it, I was working fine.

About the new note, yeah it seems good!

I also used AI tools to do similar stuff as the above commenters, mainly Java docs and testing methods.

One other way I used AI tools, was to do some refactoring of longer methods to make the code more readable.

This was a hit or miss at times because sometimes it would just make the method more compact by combining multiple statements to one.

One way this was improved was by specifying the following:

> keep the code as readable as possible while using SLAP as much as you can to break this method into parts:
> 
> _Add method here_

There is a way to rename the branches without manually unmerging. Simply rename old assertions branch to something else first, rename the old code quality branch to assertions then the old assertions branch into code quality. You can explore it in [this](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/rename-Git-branch-local-remote-GitHub-GitLab-BitBucket) page.

Make sure to follow from 

`Git branch rename command`

Onwards.

Can you try to delete the online repository version of the branch and then push ur local repository version of the branch again? Then you can check it again later when the dashboard updates.

In the meantime maybe you can show us ur git branch graph as well so we can see if there’s any issues with the order u merged/unmerged etc.

@dominopizzaaaa

I managed to recreate ur issue on my end, i think your version here is wrong:

```id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.14'```

I tried with the above version and got a similar error.

However, when I changed to version 0.1.0 like so:

```id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.1.0'```

the error went away.

From what I see in your code, maybe its because ur Main class and your launcher class are not in the same folder. Could you put the Main Class in ur GUI package and update ur build.gradle file to include the relative path of ur launcher class from `mainClass.set("Launcher")` to `mainClass.set("GUI.Launcher")` and try again?

From what I observed in your java files, I think its certainly an interesting approach to this project. 

However, I guess it would not be sustainable as the project scales as you are effectively creating 2 classes to be able to deal with a new type of task each time which in turn makes it a hassle to create a new type each time.

If you are interested, the way I reduced complexity was to keep the creation methods into the class itself and then add a single dedicated check method for the main initialization method (creation from user) so something like:


```java
    // for creation from user input
    public Deadline(String description) throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        super(description);
        String[] descriptionString = description.split("/by");
        checkInitialisationDetails(descriptionString);
        this.description = descriptionString[0].trim();
        this.deadline = getTime(descriptionString[1].trim());
        this.type = "D"; // short for Deadline
    ``}``

    // for creation from file input
    public Deadline(String description, String deadline, boolean isDone) throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        super(description);
        this.type = "D";
        this.description = description;
        this.deadline = LocalDateTime.parse(deadline);
        this.isDone = isDone;
    ``}``

    public void checkInitialisationDetails(String[] descriptionString)
            throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        if (descriptionString.length != 2) ``{``
            throw new MortalReminderException(MortalReminderException.getInvalidDeadlineDescriptionErrorMessage());
        ``}``

        try ``{``
            getTime(descriptionString[1].trim());
        ``}`` catch (DateTimeParseException e) ``{``
            throw new MortalReminderException(MortalReminderException.getInvalidDateFormatErrorMessage());
        ``}``
    ``}``
```
The reason why there is no check for the file input is because we assume it has been saved correctly by the program as it has already gone through numerous checks beforehand.

@dominopizzaaaa from what ive seen in your `build.gradle` you seemed to have removed dependencies for all the different OS versions.

Could you try to change your dependencies in that file to something like:

```groovy
dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'

    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
``}``
```

Furthermore you seem to have many ShadowJar methods and excess task methods than required. Maybe you can change the application, shadowJar and run methods to match the following:

```groovy
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("mortalreminder.io.Launcher")
``}``

shadowJar ``{``
    archiveBaseName = "MortalReminder"
    archiveFileName = "MortalReminder.jar"
    archiveClassifier = null
``}``

run ``{``
    standardInput = System.in
    enableAssertions = true
``}``
```

you can also refer to my [build.gradle](https://github.com/RezwanAhmed123/ip/blob/master/build.gradle) file for more reference.

Maybe you can share more about how you are creating the jar file in the first place then?

for myself, i did it exactly like this using the Command Line:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c8b881-fac8-424f-b567-c40ffd68db6a)

Another way to quickly see where the issue is coming from could be through the continuous integration method which is optional inside the course but I found it helpful to do a quick test to see if the app is compatible for more than my own OS. Simply follow [this](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/githubActions.html) to try and set it up. Its not too difficult, just the addition of like one folder with one file inside your directory (make sure to remove the IO redirection parts below from the file)

```groovy
      - name: Perform IO redirection test (*NIX)
        if: runner.os == 'Linux'
        working-directory:  $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        run: ./runtest.sh

      - name: Perform IO redirection test (MacOS)
        if: always() && runner.os == 'macOS'
        working-directory:  $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        run: ./runtest.sh

      - name: Perform IO redirection test (Windows)
        if: always() && runner.os == 'Windows'
        working-directory:  $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        shell: cmd
        run: runtest.bat
```

It tries to build your app in github using 3 different OS version (Ubuntu, MacOS and windows), then if there is an error you can read thru what is going on inside github like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4cbc48b-37d8-4cc4-9639-eb0b4d3123a2)

except if there is an error (not a warning like above), they will signal in red and stop the build.

I think this case is similar to issue #277 .

Your locale is probably not set up correctly leading to failures in checks.

Do also ensure that your checks properly set up and are cleaned up after each test as well (sometimes they leave fragments in your storage text files.

> Ah, I initially took a similar approach, validating both user inputs and file inputs directly within the task subclasses. However, I found that this caused the subclasses to become quite lengthy, as I was checking and parsing both file and user input within each class. In my case, I didn't have a shared parser method across all subclasses—each class had its own method for validation and parsing, which might have been the core issue. Did you encounter something similar? How did you handle it and overcome this problem?

Hi, for me I solved it by abstracting common methods as much as possible. I kept the responsibility of parsing details from both user and storage through a shared parser. The moment the input could not be parsed correctly from file an error was thrown. Type specific checks were done at the initialisation anyways which made the entire class more compact. Overall, my longest class was about 120 lines (inclusive of javadocs), which I felt was a reasonable length.

Hi, I'm not sure if this is a bug. I am on windows and I was smoke testing your app.

I opened it from the windows home view in file explorer and i could not send any commands using either "enter" key or the "send" button at the start. However, when I opened it from the downloads folder it was working fine.

I was curious about this so decided to test on my own app. I noticed if I opened it from home view in windows file explorer, I am able to send stuff but I get a "file cannot be created" feedback. So, maybe its just how errors were coded in the different apps.

Other than this issue, it was working fine.

Here is a video of what I am talking about:

@damithc Hi prof, actually the bug persists when i add to a clean environment (new empty folder by itself). I think its more of a file permission thing (as pointed out by @tata32000) as it will only create the necessary files when i access it thru its actual file location rather than a shortcut such as in recents of the windows explorer.

heres the new test:

Ok im not sure if this is definitely the issue but:

```java
        File directory = new File("data");
        File file = new File(filePath);

        if (!directory.exists()) ``{``
            directory.mkdir();
        ``}``

        if (!file.exists()) ``{``
            file.createNewFile();
            ui.showToUser("Created new data file optimus.txt");
            return taskList;
        ``}``
```

In your main class u already defined the filepath already and then here u are defining it differently here to check if it exists. So maybe, there is some bug which causes duplicated files (notice that the directory is defined separately before the file when in filepath it comes together) causing your storage class to be confused when it needs to create its own file. So it might be the reason why u are facing it outside of ur repo (because u need to create it there).

I would suggest changing the above code to the following:

```java
        File f = new File(filepath);
        f.getParentFile().mkdirs();
        f.createNewFile();
        f.exists();
```

hopefully it works for you!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Documentation Bugs: Can Documentation bugs have severity- High?**
</div>


Based on the course website, the general guidelines on severity is listed as follows: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63029d8f-9b3f-421a-be99-51ca6de3de5d)

I am wondering if the Developer Guide/ User guide having bugs can be ranked as "severity.High". 

In particular, if a use-case was suggested in the DG, but was never at all implemented in the product, therefore making it completely unusable for all developers who wish to test that function, would it be a valid "severity.High" bug? 

My confusion lies in the fact that the product still works for all other features, and is 'usable'. However, none of the functionality claimed in a section of the DG has been implemented, and would thus be 'unusable' for all users. Would this be a valid 'high'?


In the same vein, referring to the PE prep quiz: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45e4bda9-3b34-4c0d-9f38-274e82f91355)

In this example, the bug's severity was listed as 'high', but technically is still 'usable' for all users. They just need to restart the app. However, it does indeed cause a 'major inconvenience' for most users.

**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡Handling time locality uniformly across all machines**
</div>

Hi all, 

I realised that date-time parsing may throw a lot of unexpected errors, across different machines. I tested my code using Gradle, and also using Windows subsystems for linux (WSL), and was surprised to find bugs. This was similar to the issue I found in #277, where the github servers do not have the same time locale as my PC. 

To handle this, I realised I could set the time locale in my Main class, ensuring that all users who use the Jar file will have the same uniform experience as well. Here is one way to solve it: 

In the ```Main``` class:
```java
public void start(Stage stage) ``{``
        try ``{``
            // Set default locale to Singapore
            Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "SG"));
            // Set default time zone to Singapore
            TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Asia/Singapore"));
            // irrelevant code omitted
    ``}``

```

Hope this helps!

**5. :fas-info-circle: 💡Setting Time Locale for CI build to ensure consistency between local build and on Github servers**
</div>

Hi everyone, I was trying to figure out why I was failing the CI builds but passing the build and check tests locally. 

It turns out that running JUnit tests to parse dates and times locally had a different Time Locale as compared to the github servers, causing errors. 

Thought that it would be helpful to share my findings on how to resolve this! 

**Solution: Set Time locale in the test class to ensure consistency**
To ensure consistency both locally and on Github, I realised I could use the @BeforeAll annotation for Junit tests, to set a fixed time locale. 
```java
//import required for the BeforeAll annotation
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;

//Inside the test class
//    @BeforeAll
    public static void setUp() ``{``
        Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "SG"));
        TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Asia/Singapore"));
    ``}``

```

Hope this helps! 👍

I believe this may have occured because of 2 possible scenarios: 

1. Intellij may have been configured to use fully qualified class names. 
To remove this, ensure that your configuration has unchecked "Use fully qualified class names"
-> Settings -&gt; codestyle -&gt; java -&gt; imports
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a63b39-fedd-415e-9933-ec5527a999c9)
Make sure that it is unchecked. 

2. There may have been multiple imports that has the List interface
In this scenario, Intellij may find it ambiguous on which type you are declaring, hence prompting the use of fully qualified names. If this is the case, troubleshoot to see if there are multiple imports that have this interface, and removing/deconflicting if unnecessary. 


Personally, as per what @adipanda2002 said, it may also be wise to just use  `ArrayList` instead. I did this, and hence did not encounter this error

Hope this helps :)

I did something very similar to @JagdeepSinghNUS but i noticed that just typing Platform.exit() would immediate close the window, without allowing the user to read my goodbye message. 

To handle this, I added a time-delay to allow the user to read the final message (i.e: confirming that his log has been saved successfully, and the program would exit in 3 seconds) 

I did put this under the "handle input" method in MainWindow.java

Here is how I did it: 
```java
    @FXML
    private void handleUserInput() ``{``
       //earlier irrelevant part of method body not shown
        if (response.equalsIgnoreCase(monique.getUi().showGoodbye())) ``{``
            PauseTransition pause = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(3));
            pause.setOnFinished(event -&gt; stage.close());
            pause.play();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

I agree with @yadobler, I think it's best if you abstract out the variable `int id` before each `case`. 

However, if not all of the cases have an `int id`, then perhaps you current implementation where you add a closure may be better.

### Applications of AI
- Use of ChatGPT to write JUnit tests
- Use of ChatGPT to aid in writing JavaDoc comments

### General experience
- ChatGPT tends to hallucinate quite a fair bit when it comes to implementing logic. I found that it is much better to handle the logic myself, then use chatGPT to do things that do not require much logic but rather laborious and repetitive. 
- For Javadoc comments, it is wise to send over the required coding style, so that the output is consistent with the course requirements

I used streams for certain commands like the `MarkCommand`,`UnmarkCommand` and `FindCommand`. As other users have mentioned, I think streams can be used wherever there are Lists involved. In my opinion, they make the code a bit more readable. Also, I searched my repo to find code where there were for-loops used. For those, I converted it to streams to increase safety. Curious also to see how others have used this!

I think this is occuring because you already have the tag (A-MoreOOP) on your remote repository, as shown here https://github.com/Elinengu/ip/tags

I had this same problem in week 1, so what I did was delete the tag in the remote repo, and then re-push from my local repo to the remote repo. However, when I did this, it was within the same week/ same day so I don't think it would affect the scripts that were running. 

Not too sure if this will affect the IP dashboard tracking. Prof @damithc, please advise if this will cause the submission in previous weeks to be 'late' 

One alternate solution could be to:
- delete the tag on your local repo
- Merge local and remote 
- shift tag up to appropriate position in SourceTree.

I think for one of the commits (491f192), the git commit message does not start with a verb in the imperative tense. 

"Parser and Tasklist ..." 

Perhaps, you can start with "Add assertion ...". 

Apart from that, I think the length of the commit message should also be scrutinised, to ensure it is less than 72 characters long.

I believe the error message is just showing that your code violates checkstyle, which you've used when building with gradle.

There are 2 general solutions you can adopt:
1. Edit the code at all the relevant locations to satisfy checkstyle. 
Before you push to the remote repo, you can just run the build check locally, to see if the checkstyle tests pass. 
`gradlew check`

2. Disable checkstyle in your gradle build as suggested in #265

I think the reason why there is no association line drawn between History and ActionX/Y lines is because Action X/Y are stored as Repeatable objects.  History class thus only depends directly on the Repeatable class, given the method signature of add(Repeatable). This makes the UML diagram less cluttered, and more generalised, as any Repeatable object can be added to the History object. 

Regarding the email and body, since a "body" cannot exist without an email, the composition makes sense. However, the multiplicity of 0..1 indicates that an email can have no body. (e.g: imagine sending an email with just the title and no body, it would still work). Composition still makes sense, its just that the parts (i.e: body) cannot exist without the whole (email).

I think that the first diagram will likely be better. Ultimately, checking for valid arguments and the boolean seems like the objective is just input validation. Furthermore, from the diagram, it does seem they both reach the same destination (probably an exception thrown). 

In my opinion, it may be worth splitting them if they both had different outcomes/destinations. Otherwise, it seems verbose to add it.

Not 100% sure but I believe that SLAP is a guideline to improve code quality. 

Abstraction can be done on many layers. I.e: A class is an abstraction of data and behaviour. Within behaviours (i.e.: certain functions) like `calculateTotal()`, there may be some sub-steps such as `calculateStepOne()` and `calculateStepTwo()`, and so there can be multiple layers of 'abstraction'. The textbook mentions that we are encouraged to identify a suitable layer of abstraction (that fits a particular context), and then suppress the more complex details to improve understandability of the code. 

However, when implementing the abstraction in code, the `SLAP` principle pushes us to avoid deeply nested code, making it difficult for other developers to understand. We should only have a single layer of abstraction per code block, in order to increase its readability. However, within a single class file, we would have multiple layers of abstraction, but each code block only has **1 layer of abstraction**.

According to Wikipedia, the LSP states the following: 
`Let φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then φ(y) should also be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T `

Based on your supposition, if the `Admin` class assumes negative per cent values (and hence cannot work with positive values), then I believe this would violate the LSP. This is because φ in this example can refer to any function/behaviour that can be applied to the Staff class. Thus, if the admin class produces wrong results due to only having negative percent values, it does not satisfy the LSP. Essentially, the `admin` class cannot be substituted for the `staff` class, since it would result in the wrong values. 

However, if `Admin` class has the ability to handle **both positive and negative** values as the example in the textbook gives, it can be substituted in place of the staff class, hence not violating the LSP.

Not 100% sure, but I suspect the reason that C and E aren't the answer is because the method should also be annotated as ```{``abstract``}```. 

Got this wrong as well sigh. I believe it was stated that the method had no concrete/default implementation yet, hence that was a clue that it was abstract. 

This was illustrated in the textbook as follows:

Not entirely sure but I had some variations 

**For the class diagram**
- I think that the line from Countable to Readable should be a solid line, since it is an interface `extending` another interface, not implementing it. 
- Also, composition should be a filled diamond. Hollow diamonds are for aggregation
- The method for +capacity(Handout) should also be underlined because it is a class level (static) member. 
- the `closest` and `cover` should be association roles, not association labels. 
- I don't think there any composition from handout to brochure 

**For the object diagram**
- you could also show composition on the object diagram 

Here was my attempt:

For **overloaded methods**, yes the methods can have the same name but parameter types(hence different method signature). The return types can be different. I like to think of overloading as variation of a method that does a similar thing on different parameters. 
e.g: `int multiply(int num)` and `double multiply(double num)`. Both of these are overloaded methods that multiply the given `num`, but work on different types, and hence have different return types. 

On the other hand, for **overriden methods**, they are meant to change the behaviour of a function that was inherited from a base class. This enables for polymorphism to occur. The return type for the derived class can be a subtype of the return type for the base class. I think we probably did something super similar in CS2030. 

e.g: Consider `Cat extends Animal`. Assume that the Animal class has a method called `MakeNoise()` that returns an `AnimalNoise` object. By `@overriding` the `MakeNoise()` function in the `Cat` class, a `CatNoise` (subtype of AnimalNoise) can be returned.

&lt;ins> **For 1**: &lt;/ins>
 I think that the reason why 4 is not a valid option is because refactoring is not the same as bug fixing. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4649d15-41b3-43ab-8d9d-0a27049d944b)

As mentioned, the `sort()` method was not working, and the addition of an exception should fall under the definition of 'bug fixing'. In addition, it does indeed modify external behaviour. When an exception is thrown it is likely that the user will be displayed an error message, and 'gracefully' recover, as compared to crashing.  


&lt;ins> **For 2** :&lt;/ins> 
While it does not fall under the list of common refactoring, (seen below), I believe it is still considered refactoring since it does improve the code, and makes it more readable.

I think the code indicates that each `Activity` object has a reference to the `Watcher`s, and hence the navigability should be from activity to the watcher. 

Also, I believe the code still works. After each `Activity` executes, it calls the `update()` method that is implemented by `UiWidget` objects, allowing for the observable-observer pattern to still work.

Thanks for the input Prof @damithc 

I now spot the missing navigability from the handout to the section class. 

May I clarify what you meant about the dependency? I thought that we only illustrate dependencies for classes that do not have direct associations. My thought process was that since there was already composition, it implies a direct association, and hence there should not be another dependency line drawn from Handout to Section.

I think the `Command` pattern is used, and I have the same idea as you for that. 


However, I don't really think the `Observer` pattern applies here. Referring to your annotation below: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1def8f8-aceb-4976-bb4c-c118edcb2bed)
In the textbook, I believe `StudentListUi` and `StudentStatsUi` are both concrete observers, and the one being observed is the `StudentList`. Then, all concrete observers must implement the `Observer` interface. 

In the context of the question, however, it seems that `ActionX` and `ActionY` are not the observers but rather the ones being observed. They are observed by only 1 class, which is the `History` class. 

Since this `History` class did not observe the Actions `ActionX` and `ActionY` by implementing an interface, I believe this doesn't closely match the observer pattern anymore. (`History` only manages to keep track of `ActionX` and `ActionY` via directly having a list of `Repeatables`). 

Generally, if there was an interface which would have allowed multiple classes that implemented it to keep track of the `Action` objects, then perhaps I would be inclined to agree.

Hey thanks for your comment @JagdeepSinghNUS 

Quoting your response below: 
> In the part where you mentioned because it did not implement an interface, I don't think that is a requirement for observer, cause if you notice in the reference image from the textbook,  StudentList also did not implement the Observer, rather it is just associated with it for its `addUi()` method. So technically it does not need to implement the interface, however, I also don't think it is considered observer for the point I mentioned above. Hope this helps :)

Regarding this, I believe that `StudentList` does not implement the Observer interface because it is **not an observer, but rather the entity that is being observed**. From my understanding, the observers are `StudentListUi` and `StudentStatsUi`. 

Given the pattern in the textbook, only `Observer` objects need to implement the `Observer` interface. 

Observerables don't need to implement an interface, only observers do. However, observables must have an implemented method to add observer objects, and a corresponding `notifyObservers()` method.

I find it easier to solve this issue by using terminal command at master branch `git merge --no-ff branchname`. As stated in the Week 3 notes.

In my opinion, you can implement A-checkstyle and put the PR into that to see whether there is any violations.

I am not sure if this is the common issue for Mac users, but mine do not have the name stated at that place. I also checked for some available iP showcases and found out those who are using Mac do not have the label either.

For example if key in `mark 1abcd` as input and send to the bot, exception is not handled but the bot will not crash either, will it be considered as major bug?(If I remove abcd and the back and resend `mark 1`, the bot will run as normal.)

For the empty chatbox, I purposely return an empty chatbot for that situation. I am not sure if this is considered as an implementation flaw or I can leave it as it is? And for the data storage, I did not implement the stretched goal for checking corrupted database.
For the array out of bounds error message, I am pretty sure it is because of the argument length problem.(No check for argument length)

Thanks for checking!!

Hi, I have test your bot and most of the features works well!
However, I find out that the following things that may be an issue:

1. event tst /abc /from 2025-12-21 18:12 /to 2026-12-12 12:12 /dto 2027-11-04 05:14

This one ignore "/dto ....." which should not be a big issue

2. The bot never terminate after enters bye command

This one is a major issue to me as the program have no way to terminate by it self(Or this is the design of the chatbot?)

For part(d) should be correct but the exit point should be circle and a dot instead of a dot I guess. For part(a) I draw `1---*` to link handout and brochure. And I don't understand why Handout and Section is a composition relation as there is no restriction stating that a section can not exist without a handout

2) Extend MainWindow to have a Stage as a root Node.

Hi, this is from W4.3 of course topics. 

I don't understand what the diagram labels "head in" and "tail in" mean. They don't have arrows to show which direction they are referring to. Since they are closer to Snake, I would assume that it means SnakeHeadSquare's head is in Snake. 

I am not sure why the question uses the phrase "Snake head" when there is only "Snake" and "SnakeHeadSquare".

Haha I was just editing the wrong file... Was editing the test file instead of the actual class. I shifted the static import statement to the top of the non-static ones.

Hi, thanks for your reply. I can understand what abstraction is. I just think "We can even use multiple levels of abstraction." sounds weird because we are encouraged to use single level of abstraction (SLAP).

**1. :fas-info-circle: Severity of having typo when specifying filename for data modification**
</div>

Hi prof, I am currently reviewing the response of my evaluated team regarding an issue about data file naming typo.

Basically, the filename specified in the user guide is like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb3b75e-2fe3-49ea-8a45-aae37aa4fe0f)

However, the actual name of the file produced is named `talent.json`, 
![3ebbba22-263c-48a4-bc62-fdcce428bcfa](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d85fba-a64c-4730-9a73-c459218bffb1)

The team has accepted my bug report but they think that this is a `severity.veryLow` bug because it is just a typo in the file name, I can understand their reason but I feel like this can be a `severity.Low` bug instead because this is a critical operation that may potential ruin the data that the app needs and cause irreversible harm to the system. Imagine if the user wants to directly modify the data but ends up getting confused because of the difference between document and the actual file name, then he/she may be hesitant about whether he/she should modify this file. Even though there's only one data file in the data folder, I think this level of confusion may still arise because user cannot assume that data folder contains only one data file and `talent.json` may be used for a different purpose as compared to `talenthub.json`, so that's why I think it should be `severity.Low`.

May I just check if the above explanation is reasonable? or I should just accept team's response and agree that this should be `severity.veryLow`? Thank you!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Can I fix a GUI issue like this(truncated text that makes app unusable if one of the field is given very long input)**
</div>

Hi, prof. I have seen issue like #714 but I just want to clarify in our own case.

Currently, our app can wrap text of most of the fields in our contact's person card, like below
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fff42013-7696-4ac6-b77c-734b6f30765b" width="50%" alt="screenshot of normal wrapped text for long inputs without tag field"/>

However, if a very long input is supplied to create a tag for a contact, the GUI becomes like this, where all the text are no longer wrapped.
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8cca400-22d2-4383-862b-c7efca2c2416" width="50%" alt="screenshot of problematic person card due to presence of long tag"/>
(As you can see, the whole person card initially is expanded very long because the text are wrapped properly, but now it shrinks to normal height because the words becomes truncated after a long tag is created.)

In this case, is this considered as a serious bug and can be fixed in v1.6? Thank you prof!

**4. :fas-info-circle: Failed test cases from the iP repo for iP evaluation**
</div>

Hi prof, I am currently going through the code of iP project that I was assigned through the email, but I have stuck at the part of checking **test & exceptions** because the situation is bit complicated and I would need advice on how to evaluate the work...

Basically, the test case files are not inside a package called test and instead they are under the respective package of the files that they test against(like TaskListTest.java is together with TaskList.java in the same package). As a result, when gradle runs, the tests are not triggered because gradle couldn't find the source to run the test. (As you can see, the test task is not run at all and gradle indicate the reason as no source)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908ea321-c3db-4ff1-b3a2-10b5966618c4)

I am not sure if the above issue is a big deal, but when I try to clone this repo and run the test cases locally, I realized there are actually test cases that failed. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b23483d-88ea-4233-842c-1cb7d7e7f392)

I feel like if everything is like this then the test cases are not properly written and no longer serves the purpose. I have tested the product and it works fine but I think the test is implemented very poorly. In this case how should I grade this project? Should I give 0 because the test cases do not serve the desired purposed, or should I give 1 since there are at least 1 or 2 methods tested for each class? Thank you prof for your time!

    1. In `Functionality bugs`, there is one part that says `be not than 8 digits`, which should be `be not more than 8 digits`.

**8. :fas-info-circle: Implemented stream before this weeks increment, can I simply tag that commit as A-Stream? Also, seeking more advices on use of streams**
</div>

Hello prof, I would like clarify if it is ok to tag a previous week's commit with current week's increment tag? Because I realize that my project actually has already implemented some methods with the help of Java stream which means my project technically fulfills the requirement specified by A-Stream, and I am not really sure where else I can actually implement stream within my program. Thank you.

Also, for others who are currently working on this week's tasks, what are your use of streams in your own program? For me, I have designed my delete task method to accept multiple task numbers as variable arguments, and since ArrayList will left shift all the objects after the deleted object after deletion, I have used stream to map the task numbers to corresponding tasks in the ArrayList and delete them by object reference instead of index(because left shifting of object will mess up the index of the rest of object, introducing error to the feature) to ensure the correct objects are deleted. Would appreciate if anyone can offer some hints on other possible usage of stream, so I can try make some new improvements instead of just tagging previous commit for this week task, thank you!

**10. :fas-info-circle: 💡Duke Level-1: Allow case-insensitive comparison for user inputs using equalsIgnoreCase()**
</div>

Hello guys, just sharing a tip over here in case if you are wondering how you can make your chatbot more flexible when handling user inputs as an enhancement for user experience. I know this is not compulsory requirement for the project, but it may be helpful if you are wondering about how to do it in Java.

In Java we know that we can use `equals()` method to compare the values of two String objects instead of their references, however, we can use `equalsIgnoreCase()` method if you not only want to compare the String Objects just by values but also want the comparison to be case-insensitive. This method can be useful if you want the chatbot to response to a certain command regardless of how exactly it is spelled.

For example, if you want the chatbot to say goodbye to the user and exit regardless of whether the user inputs "Bye", "BYE", "bye" or any other form. Instead of writing 
```
if (userInput.equals("bye")) ``{``
    // Your exit logic
``}``
```
you can write something like this
```
if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("bye")) ``{``
    // Your exit logic
``}``
```
Hope that helps if you are seeking some improvements for your project, thank you.

</div>

@somethingfishyfishy My reasonings when answering this question are like these:

1. Even though score of the team is discrete and finite, we may want to perform arithmetic operations on it, such as adding a score when the team wins a game or subtracting the score when the team receives a penalty, which is not supported by the enum type, (and just to add on, enum types are usually used for comparison, switch statements and other non-arithmetic operations) hence representing the team score using enum type variable is not appropriate.

2. Just like what @ITLimJiaWei has mentioned above but I would like to just add on. One of the key reason why we use enum types in our program is to ensure that our users don't enter garbage values into the system which can potentially cause a lot of errors and issues, and it is one of the way that strongly typed languages like java used to limit user input to a finite set of possible options while still ensuring type safety in the system. However, in this case you are just working with very large range of int values where you just need to check about the values and not the types. Therefore, instead of exhaustively declare each int value as a enum type value which greatly compromise the readability and performance of the program, it is better to just use conditional statement to check whether the team's score is within the acceptable range.

Hope that helps.

I agree with @cth06-Github 's opinion that using enum for recognizing command type introduces redundant logics within the program. I am also a bit confused about the possible use of enums within the current scope of the project, but if more customization is allowed at this stage of project development, I believe we can use enum to specify status of the task(just like all these other task management outside, we can have more status than just done & not done, such as cancelled) and the priority of the task(low, medium, high etc.), because they both represents finite and discrete sets of values which we want the user to choose from.

I think at this point of time you can leave it as it is, but putting it inside a `handleExit()` method may help in the future if your program actually needs to invoke multiple clean up methods before the program actually exit, in that case having a method to handle exit logics and stuff all the clean up methods inside can make the code a lot cleaner. Hope this idea helps

I realize that when the message box is too big, the pointing edge of the dialog bubble would not correctly point to the avatar as the avatar itself would always stay the top of the control.
But there's an easy workaround with this issue, all you need to do is just wrap the ImageView that represent the avatar in a VBox and set the alignment to `BOTTOME_CENTER` like below:
```
<VBox alignment="BOTTOM_CENTER">
            <ImageView fx:id="displayPicture" fitHeight="99.0" fitWidth="99.0" pickOnBounds="true" preserveRatio="true"/
</VBox>
```
and then you can easily get the result like the above image.

Hi, I have tried played around with the `checkstyle.xml` file and this approach may help with your issue.
1. First locate the following block of code in your `checkstyle.xml`
```
&gt;!--
    IMPORT CHECKS
    -->

    &gt;!-- Checks the ordering of import statements follow the rules that the default Eclipse formatter uses.
    The order rule "STATIC###STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE###SPECIAL_IMPORTS###THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE" consists of:
      1. STATIC: static imports
      2. STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE: standard java/javax imports
      3. SPECIAL_IMPORTS: defined as org imports
      4. THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE: defined as com imports
    -->
    <module name="CustomImportOrder">
        <property name="customImportOrderRules"
            value="STATIC###STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE###SPECIAL_IMPORTS###THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE"/>
        <property name="specialImportsRegExp" value="&hat;org\."/>
        <property name="thirdPartyPackageRegExp" value="&hat;com\."/>
        <property name="sortImportsInGroupAlphabetically" value="true"/>
    </module>
```
2. Change `<property name="specialImportsRegExp" value="&hat;org\."/>` to `<property name="specialImportsRegExp" value="&hat;javafx\."/>`
3. Change `<property name="thirdPartyPackageRegExp" value="&hat;com\."/>` to `<property name="thirdPartyPackageRegExp" value="&hat;zbot\."/>`

Now you should see the warning fading away when you use your own way to import packages. I have tried this approach in my own code and it works pretty well:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70723399-7124-44d8-9719-91a3bec539fa" width="50%" />

However, just to say that I don't fully understand the initial values used by these two properties so there may be some repercussions when you change the file in the above way. But the general idea should be group the imports in separate groups and specify their order in the `CustomImportOrder` property, then `checkstyle.xml` should automatically reinforce line separations between the desired groups.

Sorry if I misinterpret this, but I believe that the notes and the webinar is talking about different things. You can refer to the diagram included in the textbook as part of my reasoning:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c1a844-6326-4da7-a9f0-94fb5121c42f)

Note mentions **UML class diagram** which is only about the class diagram and it is true that it shows shows the structure and not the behavior because the diagram only shows the associations between the classes and nothing else.

Webinar, on the other hand, mentions **UML diagram** which can consists of may different kinds of diagram and some of them such as state machine diagram and user case diagram can be used to model behaviors of the program.

Hence, in my opinion, there's no discrepancy between the above contents. Hope that helps with the issue, some please correct me if I am wrong thank you

Works well on my machine! Good job!

**Some issues that you may want to take it seriously**:
1. Program is not responding me with any error message when I input `delete -1`, while it shows error message when I input `mark -1` and `unmark -1`
2. It seems like your `mark` and `delete` commands are giving out similar but differently phrased error message, I am not sure why is that the case and maybe this is the cause of issue 1? Just be sure that you handle this kind of error through a single method so that everything can behave as expected in a consistent manner.
3. When I mess up the task file and enter the application again, tasks with invalid save data becomes null on the list(and in some other cases jar file can't be opened any more due to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`). As a result, I can't even close the application either because the code that handles saving feature can't handle null objects properly. Not sure if this is serious or not...But I believe it is better to address situations when the file is corrupted when user opens the application, just like how we did for the CLI version.

Just to add on, your user guide is super amazing and impressive, I can see that you are really putting in a lot of effort to craft  it! Good job!

Sorry but someone please correct me if I am wrong, I don't think this is how you should include emoji in your GFMD, you should use markdown language to specify the emoji as well instead of just copy pasting them like this, for more detail can refer to this [GFMD emoji cheat sheet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md&ved=2ahUKEwjHrKieuc-IAxWaTGwGHbe9F1UQjjh6BAgXEAE&usg=AOvVaw1ZAGUCBD1x16WQz339KJ7L).

It works well, good job! No serious issues found, but maybe somethings to take note:
1. For the submission of Ui.png, I remember one of the requirements is to show the product name in the screenshot and preferably at the title of the application window, so you may want to fix on that.
2. The cmd window keeps on showing messages as I inputting commands, especially when I open the application, it feels a bit weird that the welcome message shows in the cmd instead of on the application window.
3. As according to the requirement and prof's reply to other people's clarification(see #309), it would be better if you can include logic that will warn user about corrupted save file when they open the application. Currently if I mess up the local save file, the tasks are simply not created on the application which I believe is not major bugs, but it is still better if you can fix it.

Hi I am using Windows 11, it works well on my machine.
I think there may be something that you may want to look into and fix?:
1. I think this is a trivial one because normal user wouldn't do something like this, but it seems like you are storing time as string for your task? and as a result I can input something like 25pm or 100pm without the program complaining about anything...Also, I believe it is possible for a user to accidentally typed some other things when inputting time and causes unexpected behaviour of your program. Even though user can delete and add in the correct one(provided he/she realized about the typo), it may fail the iP requirement of handling error gracefully, but whether to fix it is up to you. Personally I as a user think this is acceptable, but you may not want to handle things in this way again during the tP.
2. The user guide says that the command `remind` will remind user of the upcoming deadlines and events but the program only shows me events that happened on that day and not the deadlines, so you may want to either fix your program if this is not the intended behaviour or fix the user guide if it shows the wrong instruction
3. Currently the program does not show any error message if the file is corrupted

I think the association line between History and ActionX/Y are not necessary because this can be inferred from the class diagram itself. Since History object tracks references of Repeatable Interface Object(which is implemented by Action abstract class and eventually inherited by ActionX/Y classes), this implies that History would have references to ActionX and ActionY objects(as history, as indicated by the association role between History and Repeatable objects).

For the email body part, I think composition only implies that child's existence must depend on parent's existence and not the other way around. In some cases, you may initialize a parent object with some of its parts being undefined and only assign them afterwards, then this would actually imply a multiplicity of 0 for the child object. One possible case I can think of maybe is like other than Email class, I want to create a Draft Class that contains the information that I want to send but haven't finished yet, then in case when I try to save an email as a draft, I may create a Draft object in which the body is null. Hence, even though in this case body is part of the Draft, I can still have its multiplicity as 0, and the fact that Draft has-a body only implies that when I delete this draft, its body also gets deleted as well and not the other way around.


Hope these helps.

I think can refer to this past issue [Codecov test failing](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/325) if the UI components are hard to test. From week 8's topics it seems like we aren't really expected to learn how to carry out those automated GUI testing, and test coverage itself is not really part of the assessing criteria

Hi, sorry if I misunderstand the question or just mentioning the obvious parts which you may have already take into considerations, but from prof's explanation in the video(at 06:47), the read() methods are repeated in the child classes because they are implemented differently from the parent class(overriding parent implementation instead of just inheriting from the parent class). On the other hand, if the read() method is just inherited then we should not include them. 

You can also refer to diagrams that are included in the course material under the inheritance UML class diagram section to check this out. For example,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32a60119-b1bc-4b22-9d4c-00bf9b4f2bb9)

In this case, the Car class does not need to include the fields and methods inherited from Vehicle, assuming that Car does not override them.

@damithc Hi prof, I have tried the new one and it is working now, but I just notice that the search may a bit inefficient...Not sure if it is the same as using Mac, but searching using keyword `uml` takes 30 sec+ to load the results, `activity diagram` takes 1 min+, and invalid keyword `dsafafdsaf` takes 40 sec+. I feel like the search is not very effective and could still potential affect the exam, is there anyway this can be optimized to give better search efficiency? Thank you very much

I think this question can be answered by a past response by prof over [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/478)
Basically, if the parent class is overridden by the subclass, then this method has to be included in this sub class, else it must not be included there

1. `This leads me to question whether it is necessary to explicitly mark methods in an interface as abstract (e.g., by using ``{````}`` or italics), or if doing so is unnecessary. Does the label of interface &lt;&lt;interface>> implicitly mark all its methods to be abstract?`
This is a very good question, actually I am wondering the same but I guess it is safe to assume the answer to be yes. The reason why I am wondering the answer of this is because it is actually possible to be have concrete implementation in an interface, through the use of default keyword, which specifies the default behaviour of a given method signature if a class implements the interface but does not provide its own implementation. But I vaguely remember that such practice is not recommended, not sure if it is because of the presence of abstract class, but I will go and find out about this. If this is true, then I think can just assume `&lt;&lt;interface>>` discriminator implies all methods to be abstract.
2. `Adding on, I note that the overridden method update(int) in UIWidget is marked as public even though it's actual method signature is not shown, can I assume that for a class that implements an interface, the overridden methods will always be public?`
Note that a overriding method in Java can only have access modifier that is equally or more general than the access modifier of the original method. As you have already mentioned, methods in interface are implicitly public by default, hence any overriding methods in classes that implement this interface would have the access modifier to be public, therefore it is true that the overriden methods will always be public.

Hope this helps, and hopes someone can help me clarify on first part as well. I will try my best to figure out an answer and reply over here as well, thank you very much!

Ok, I have clarified a bit on the first point in my own explanation above, it seems like default keyword in interface is actually an approach to deal with legacy code and an easy fix to allow for extension of interface functionalities without breaking the existing code. Basically, before Java 8, interface is really only consists of abstract methods, but as the current codebase extends for future Java version, it is realized that adding new method signature to the interface requires all the existing classes that implement this interface to include their own implementation of this method respective, which is very time consuming and labor intensive. Therefore, they use default keyword to provide concrete implementation of the method to provide flexibility for the implementing class, which allows them to **not** provide their own implementation for a certain method in the interface. Similarly, interface also allows static methods for a similar reason as above.

However, that being said, it seems like such issue can be common in modern day software as well(interfaces of existing system may need to be extended with new methods without forcing existing classes to provide their own implementation). I understand that static method in interface can still be easy to annotate and differentiate, just by underlining them. But for default method, I can't find any info in UML Diagrams about this, probably because this is a Java language design choice and not a general info that needs to be described by UML, but I am also curious if there's a way to properly annotate default method in interface using UML.

Hi Prof @damithc, is there anything to work around this issue in UML? Thank you very much!

Hi thanks, i manage to somehow get the .jar file to work by adding this line of code:
'''
file.getParentFile().mkdirs();
''''

The problem for my .jar file previously was that it could not find the .txt file.
So, I created a .txt file in the directory of the jar file with the code above.

However, I am still not sure why is it that windows have this issue whereas from others, MACOS and Unix seem to work fine..? (i.e. windows cannot find the file path but macos and UNIX can find)

Maybe you could set an ``` assert false; ``` to the start of the run method to see if the program crashes at the start of the program?

Using windows machine here too:

The bot did not respond when i typed in an invalid date. But at least it didn't crash, that's great.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c73dc0a2-0ac5-49e5-a2af-4e14d0acb775)

Just maybe can handle if the date is before the current date, don't allow it maybe 🤔
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9b4b0d-c205-42cd-9b58-04a2d555f39a)

or if the end date is &lt; than the start date:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/096d040a-5f20-4c19-981e-b31ea104d94c)

But overall no crashes! Well done!

I am currently trying to update my team's user guide and was hoping to follow some aspects of AB3's user guide.

However, the following code does not print out the TOC.
```md
&gt;!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />
```

Similarly, following the way AB3 [does it](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md) by using ```{``\:toc``}``` does not work and will result in the UG page not rendering.

Has anyone managed to automatically generate their TOC?

**5. :fas-info-circle: Deadline for updating UML in Week 10**
</div>

Hi Prof, 

Currently on the course website there is no deadline stated for adding a UML diagram in `v1.4` as it is a recommendation.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f33acb13-0059-4cb9-832d-825d7e6c880c)

But it seems that the tP tracker is tracking that we are required(?) to do at least 3 lines of changes to any `*.puml` file.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06d61d58-ceab-45da-9fca-379f2b64ce2f)


Can I check if we are graded on adding a UML diagram for Week 10? It seems that only 20% of the cohort has done it so far as well so there might be some confusion.

Hi, just wanted to share for those facing this issue when attempting A-CI increment.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50241632-a906-4df3-881e-630df4457a6c)

I solved this issue by following this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64059610/how-to-resolve-refusing-to-allow-an-oauth-app-to-create-or-update-workflow-on).

TLDR:
1. Creating a Personal Access Token in my Github account.
> Must store the PAT string somewhere as it will not be shown again once you leave the page.
2. Enable both repo and workflows in the PAT.
3. Removing all Github credentials (follow steps below the answer).
4. Login to SourceTree with PAT.
5. Push commit again.

Additionally, if you receive errors in your CI pipeline, you can check what went wrong under the `Actions` tab of your repo.

I had issues with CheckStyle and my JUnit tests, which caused my CI to fail.

Doesn't seem like your classes are put into a package so maybe try ```mainClass.set("JohnCena")``` in your build.gradle instead.

For my own bot, since my code are all in a ```lbot``` package, it is ```mainClass.set("lbot.Launcher")```.

Hi @kngys, my group interpreted keywords as  command words and also the parameters your product has.

i.e. `add` and `ADD` or even `Add` should be recognised as the same command word

regarding parameters, an example could be like names such as `John Doe` and `john doe` should be recognised the as the same name


ultimately, i think it is up to your group's discretion as long as you guys can justify it!

My group had this sort bug as well, and after reading through the FAQ multiple times, it seemed like fixing the bug is allowed. But reading it again after seeing @Runus01's comment, I think we are not allowed to fix it?

I think the FAQ has been worded rather confusingly, my confusion comes in from the highlighted part below here that seems to contradict what is mentioned at the start of the section.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0593b55-f661-4441-b892-05d990b406ff)

Does this mean that if my group realised that the sort commands were sorting by ascii but tried to bug fix it to sort by alphabetical order before v1.6, then we are allowed to fix this bug? 
Or does it mean that since we intended to sort by alphabetical order, but it doesn't work as such so we are allowed to fix it?

Perhaps the teaching team can update the Fixing PE-D bugs section to explicitly state what kind of bugs can be fixed, rather than what is not allowed in future iterations of the course. 

I would argue actually that we should be allowed to fix all bugs, minus feature flaws (aka feature does not support the use case well enough/does not support the user's use case at all).

Since we only have approximately 3 days until the final deadline on Tuesday and groups have to first sift through the issues reported, which might take up to a day depending on number of bugs reported. This will force groups to prioritise fixing of bugs or ensuring their UG/DG are in a usable  state, teaching groups about managing the trade offs.

I can comment on the abstract one. I believe newer versions of Java allow for default implementations of abstract methods, iirc from CS2030S but I'm not sure if Java 17 supports that

Hi prof @damithc, for "Removing the store() method from the Bar class will cause a compile error"

My understanding is that since we are using Java 17, interfaces do allow for default implementation of methods since Java 8 as seen [here](https://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/27/everything-about-java-8/)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03012f46-41ea-412b-91cc-4df280b55a2b)


Does this impact the question or is there a different notation for class diagrams to state that a method in an interface has a default implementation? I think this question can be extended to abstract classes as well, since they also support default implementations now.

@damithc i see, thanks! will take note of this :)

so it's right to say that for any interface all their methods have not been implemented and for any abstract classes, as long as their methods do not have ```{``abstract``}```, those methods have an implementation?

Hi, may I ask, we realised that there was a mismatch between the UG and the error message. In this, we did not state clearly in the error message that only one of the parameters is allowed for the command, and the display in the error message is a bit misleading. To quote the bug report we received: 

> From' the status message of Delete (seen when delete is entered), there are no square brackets around parameters (INDEX, n/NAME etc.). This means that the parameters are compulsory, as seen from the Features section in the UG.  However, the Delete command only accepts 1 out of the listed parameters which conflicts with the compulsory parameters explanation.

We were thinking of simply adding "or" in between the parameters. Will this be counted as an error (and not feature enhancement) and thus be allowed in this stage?

**1. :fas-info-circle: What exactly is considered a What for code comment (with reference to AY17/18 Sem 1 Paper Q4)**
</div>

<img width="328" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c158790-e014-4a14-9901-a51bc5564972">

&hat;In this question we are supposed to suggest 5 code quality improvements. In #891 the original poster shared his/her answers in which it was highlighted that the JavaDoc comment has issues as it should specify the "Why" and "What" of the code instead of writing the "How"(code implementation). I thought the JavaDoc comment is referring to the "What" of the code. From my understanding, "What" is about "the specification of what the code is supposed to do" and "How" is about the explanation how the code works. <br>

I think it is considered a "What" because the JavaDoc comment there describes what the code is expected to do. The "How" can be seen as the even more low-level and nitty-gritty details on how the numbers and spaces are removed + sorting + 10 letters replacement. However, I realised that the function name is "encode" - `encode(String original)`. So in another perspective, it could be considered a "How" because at the same time, the same JavaDoc description can be considered as explaining the step by step process of the code for encode, of how things should get encoded. The "What" is the encoding, i.e. if the Javadoc start with "encodes a string by removing space and numbers..." , it will sound more like a "What". <br>

While I think the main issue is that the first word of the JavaDoc should be "Removes" rather than "Remove", the main question of this case I have is whether the JavaDoc comment is still considered sufficiently a "What"? Because it seems that there can be 2 interpretations here, which feels very subjective.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Drawing UML Class diagram for AY17/18 Sem 1 Paper Question 1**
</div>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a12ad24-b441-4bee-b6db-6bf3153e148b)
&hat;On the left of the image is the question of the paper (Q1), and on the right are the diagrams to refer to as I explained my 2 questions below. &lt;br>

1] For drawing `Allocation` class, which is an association class as indicated by the code comments in the question, I think the one where I draw it as a concrete class -- the first UML class diagram on the right (without the red arrow) in the yellow region is valid. But if I want to represent it as an association class, would it be mandatory to remove the attributes as indicated in red? I'm wondering if it is the same reason as why we do not show associations as lines and attributes at the same time -- by keeping the attributes indicated in red, we are showing 2 times and therefore we _must_ remove `owner` and `task` from the attribute compartment of `Allocation` class. Is my reasoning correct? &lt;br>

2] Thanks to #891 where [Virusrwj223](https://github.com/Virusrwj223) shared his/her answers. I am wondering for putting in the ProjectManager and StaffManager as per question, should these classes be shown as classes that inherited `Person` class? No where in the question explicitly said that these classes are subclass of `Person`, yet semantically ProjectManager and StaffManager is indeed a person, thus are we expected to catch that subtle hint and make `ProjectManager` and `StaffManager` classes inherit `Person` or is this considered an assumption that we should not make since the question did not explictly specify?

&hat;Is the above picture considered an UML class diagram, or say still correct notation? This [picture in Exercise 3 of week 11 Tutorial](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week11/tutorial.html) seems to suggest that it is a UML, but the dashed arrow (boxed in green) and the solid arrow (boxed in red) seems to represent input and output respectively, instead of dependency and association with navigability as what we usually do when using arrows. Thus I would like to ask if it is still considered a class diagram and if Yes, are these 2 arrows indeed allowed to be drawn in a class diagram? <br> 

Because in the event that we are asked to draw a class diagram that follows the Facade pattern, I'm wondering if it is correct to add these 2 arrows.

**4. :fas-info-circle: Is delete object notation in a way optional in sequence diagram unless otherwise stated?**
</div>

This question came about when looking at the answers in #841 and #878 for Sequence diagrams part (c) of the Additional Practice. In #841, the delete objection notation was used to indicate that the Unit object is ready to be garbage-collected, but in #878, there was no indication for the object deletion. Is it alright to omit the delete object notation? Attach a reference image of the Sequence diagram and my question (okay to omit the X?):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f747e77-45f5-4deb-b593-a7ffbea07371)

In addition, for the videos in [Week 8 Topics](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week8/topics.html) going through the sequence diagrams, it seems that it is okay to omit the delete object notation unless otherwise stated
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f092b69f-d4f4-469f-ae2a-fb4f2820b4a4)

I understand that showing object "deletion" is possible only if the object is dereferenced. For the `TaskList` sequence diagram, I think the Task object can be "deleted" (as in ready to be garbage-collected) after the `generate()` finished executing as there are no attributes or any variables that are keeping a reference of the Task object. However, it seems that we don't have to show it also. Thus, I would like to clarify when we should use delete objection notation, and whether for the additional Practice part (c), the delete object notation _must_ be shown as in #841.

**5. :fas-info-circle: Whats the Design Pattern for AY18/19 Sem 1 Question 1b**

I was doing Q1 of AY18/19 Sem 1 Part 2 (see picture below), and the relevant class diagram for that was explained in one of the videos going through drawing class diagrams in [Week 8 Topics](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week8/topics.html) (specifically, "Drawing class/object diagrams (intermediate) - `Action`, `Task`, `History`") (it's the same question used). Using that class diagram as the basis, I tried to answer 1b), which asked what design pattern it is.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b284c64-bd90-4a36-9604-12b97fc03782)

I felt that there are 2 design patterns here: Command pattern and Observer pattern. The image showed how I saw the similarity for both patterns. However, question 1b felt like we can only choose _1_ pattern. I was wondering if my analysis went wrong, or that if there are really 2 design patterns, is there one that is more prominent than the other? (Which I don't see it now). Or it will be ok to just state any of the correct design patterns?

**6. :fas-info-circle: Extra Practice Question (a) - is association roles and labels in class diagrams possibly interchangeable?**
</div>

I was looking at the class diagrams drawn for part (a) in Additional practice questions for part 2 in issues #878 and #840 . I realised that most students drew the attributes as association labels, though some drew as association roles (and there seems to have a mix of both too). Here is my version of the answer after my attempt + viewing the comments in both issues:
<img width="537" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58c44d58-0301-4c08-9f60-c3945c2ecde9">

I tend to use association roles to represent the attributes of a class, as highlighted in the picture. Is there any particular point in time we should use association roles, and when for association labels? Or would it always be acceptable to use either of them?<br>

(If there is anything wrong with / comments about the diagram, feel free to point it out, I will appreciate it)

Same here, I was thinking to use enum for the commands but Iater on I disagreed or something is missing because the command we type into the input is in String type, and there may be additional steps to check for correspondence between the enum type and String type?  We can do switch-case statement with string commands and have a default case to throw an exception, something like:

```
case "list":
    // whatever code logic
case "todo":
  // whatever code logic
default:
  // throw exception to show that command has been keyed in wrongly
```
which seems simpler than involving enum.
(so based on that thinking, I am also not sure how we can use enums as well)

Here's my take for the question: &lt;br>
**Why "`Bar` class is overriding the `process()` method" is true** &lt;br>
`Foo` class has a method called `process()`, and `Bar` inherits class `Foo`, as indicated by the solid arrow with an unshaded arrowhead in the UML diagram. Given that there is a method `process()` in `Bar` as well, which will "clash with" `process()` in `Foo` class, `process()` in `Bar` class should be overridden to make the code work/compile. 

&lt;br>

**Why "Removing the `process()` method from the `Bar` class will not cause a compile error" is true**
As you have mentioned, The abstract method didn't state that its method is abstract, so removing it will not cause compile error. If I may rephrase, it means that `process()` in `Foo` class is not abstract. If I am not wrong, an abstract class need not have an abstract method too. Since `process()` in `Foo` is not abstract, then there is no need to define (implement) the `process()` method in `Bar`.  Thus, removing `process()` from `Bar` class will not affect anything, there won't be compile error. Since `Bar` is a child class of `Foo`, and if `process()` in Bar is removed, when a Bar Object call `process()` (e.g. `barObject.process()` then it is the `Foo's process()` that gets invoked (call the parent method). 

&lt;br>

**Why "Removing the store() method from the Bar class will cause a compile error" is true**
`Goo` is an interface with the `store()` method. Therefore, any class that implements `Goo` must have the method `store()` defined/implemented in their own class, otherwise there is compile error. Since `Bar` implements `Goo`, removing `store()` will result in compile error as it is required of `Bar` to define/implement `store()` as its methods. 

&lt;br>

The question asked for the incorrect statement (not correct statement), so (iv) is the answer as explained in the answer key. Hope this helps.

Here's what I think: &lt;br>

I think the key idea is that any diagram that is modelling a solution should not be used. Because we want to model a **problem** (domain modelling), not a solution. Class diagrams are meant to model after solutions. Why sequence diagrams can model a problem -- 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3348356-8b6d-411b-88a9-36fb5ec896d5)
&hat;obtained from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams/

I think sequence diagram can be used to see how things interact as time passed, which can be used to model a problem. &lt;br>

Why class diagram can only(?) model after solutions -- because class diagram contains methods(?) (I think that's the reason, but can't be 100% confident). When we model a problem, there is no such concept as a method/function in that correspond in real life I would think. Attributes still make sense perhaps considering how the snake and ladder modelling is done via conceptual class diagram in the textbook. I think that is also the reason why one of the key difference in Conceptual class diagrams (CCDs) is that there are no methods in CCDs.

I think it will be better to use [less than 3 times] and [else] because currently the case of 3 times is not considered. Alternatively, I think [more than and equals to 3 times] (instead of [more than 3 times]) works as well. Very minute differences here, I trust the exam won't be that tricky to give such options!

I agree with @CYX22222003 

To add on, interface cannot be instantiated, so it's not possible to have an interface object, thus there won't be an interface in object diagram.
From #878, Prof commented that for the part b question which requires drawing an object diagram, the composition is missing. This to me suggests that showing composition, (and by extension, aggregation) can be drawn for object diagram.

Message edited: dependencies should not be shown in object diagrams too.

To be honest, I'm not very sure. I wanted to say it should be fine to omit some of the attributes because it depends on what we want to highlight to the readers. Though it's quite interesting why the particular use of word "compartment". &lt;br>
It is interesting to note that for class diagrams, the textbook explicitly stated that some of the attributes can be omitted:
> The 'Operations' compartment and/or the 'Attributes' compartment may be omitted if such details are not important for the task at hand. **Similarly, some attributes/operations can be omitted if not relevant to the purpose of the diagram**

I don't see why the object diagram should be any different from the class diagram. So perhaps it is okay to only show some of the attributes for object diagrams. Another way to think about it is perhaps to think about how we are always told that if the diagram don't say anything, we can't assume anything. Using the context of the question, including `heading` attribute in the object diagram will tell the readers that the object has a heading attribute, and has the value "Intro". Is that statement correct? Even though the statement made no mention to `isFull` and `page`, that perhaps does not matter because the statement, in itself, is true. So based on that, perhaps omission of some attributes in object diagrams is still acceptable.

I think the reason is because there is no (direct) association from `Task` to `Action`. From the image I screenshot, the code `Repeatable owner` in `Task` class indicates that there is an association from `Task` to `Repeatable`, thus there is an arrow drawn from `Task` to `Repeatable` in the class diagram. No where else in the code for `Task` class suggests that there is an association from `Task` to `Action`. <br>

We can infer that there is an association from `Action` to `Task` due to the code `List<Task> tasks` in the `Action` class.

@emmannyyy 
If I may input:
You are right that we only illustrate dependencies for classes that do not have direct associations. However, for the class diagram required of that question, the direct association is from `Handout` class to `Section` class, and **not** from `Section` class to `Handout` class. Without the dependency drawn in the class diagram, we will not know that `Section` class depends on `Handout` class. &lt;br>

Let's say if the `Section` class contains the class-level method as `public static void capacity()` (don't have the parameter required), then `Section` class does not depend on `Handout` class because `Handout` did not appear anywhere in the code for `Section` class. &lt;br>

As the `Section` class contains the class-level method as `public static void capacity(Handout h)`  where the parameter `h` must belong to `Handout` class, it means that `Section` class depends on `Handout` class, i.e. a relationship from `Section` to `Handout`. As stated earlier, there is no association from `Section` to `Handout`, thus dependency needs to be included.

> However, in the case that there are two objects, one is of the parent class and another of the children class, do we need to show inheritance here?

It will be very strange to show inheritance. For example, class B inherits class A. I have object A `objA` of class A and object B `objB` of class B. If we draw like this:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82996cc5-fdfc-4e68-af3c-66d56937cdf7)

While it does ensure that every object is shown only once, I think conceptually wise, it feels weird, as if `objB` is related to `objA` when `objB` and `objA` is not related in any way except their _class_. So I don't think it is correct to draw like this. Composition and aggregation relationship in objects still make sense I think. &lt;br>

> I note that you say there won't be an interface object in the object diagram as it's impossible to have an interface object. However, we are allowed to use the interface type as the reference type of an object right? For example, if class A implements interface B, and we have an object of type A, it's valid to do a:B even though B is an interface. Am I correct?

Good question, I never thought about it. I wanted to say I don't see why not, i.e. I think it can be correct because any implementation has a `is-a` relationship. So object A is an A, and object A is a B are both valid and therefore a:B can be correct, if argued that way. However, I also note in the textbook that:

> objectName:ClassName is meant to say 'an instance of ClassName identified as objectName'.

So according to that, if we write a:B, it is saying that an instance of `interface B` identified as `a`. An interface cannot be instantiated so saying that there are instances of an interface is not correct, therefore writing as a:B is not correct when argued this way. &lt;br>

These are my thoughts, I am more inclined to go with the latter because in the text book, generic notation for object diagrams is described as `instance:Class` -- there seems to be an emphasis that it is a **class**.

If others and prof @damithc  can chime in, that will be great as well.

I don't think there is a default case stated. There is no `default` keyword. &lt;br>
Sequence diagram is to show how things interact with each other, for this case for `run()` -- it is possible to show **all** cases. Hint: use the alt symbol. (You may refer to issue #841 and #878 for inspiration/answers, maybe it will provide a clearer idea how showing both cases can be done)

I think that it is acceptable to have multiple end points, and also acceptable to have a single end point as well. It is a matter of "aesthetics" / readability. Both works so long as we make the diagram not too messy to read. &lt;br>

In the issue you linked, the "end point being different" was meant to refer that the symbol of the end point is not the same as the start point -- the end point symbol should consist of a circle circling the rounded fat dot and not merely a rounded fat dot (rounded fat dot as in a filled circle).

Hmm I think while "alt can choose not to take any path" remains correct, perhaps alt frame can only be used when there are **2 or more** paths. If it is just 1 path, we should use opt frame.

Thank you @emmannyyy and @JagdeepSinghNUS for your inputs. <br>

I feel that @JagdeepSinghNUS made a very good point, though if that's the case does it mean the solution for tutorial 11 exercise 3 is incomplete because there is a missing `notifyWatcher()` method in the `<<Observable>> Process` class?

(to use the full solution instead of the partial solution as above, and incorporating `notifyWatcher()` that seems to be missing):

## Use of AI Tools in the Project

* **GitHub Copilot** to auto-generate code snippets in some methods to save time.
* **ChatGPT** to generate the task description for the task, `Parser` class, and unit tests.

## What Works Well

**GitHub Copilot** is a great tool for generating code snippets for methods that are not implemented yet. It saves time and helps to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input string was generated by GitHub Copilot.

**ChatGPT** is a great tool for generating the task description for the task and `Parser` class. It saves time and helps to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input string was generated by ChatGPT. The tool is also very helpful for generating unit tests for the project. Javadoc is also generated using ChatGPT.

We are told to use asserts liberally. However for example, if we have a constructor with 3 parameters, would writing asserts for all boundary values for all parameters be too much? This could easily lead to at least 10 assert statements.

Perhaps this can be used as an example.

Could this issue possibly arise from the use of the autoformatter?

@damithc Yes it can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md?plain=1). Starting from the info box above "How the `Logic` component works:".

That seems to be the issue! However, any line break causes it to break. So how do we approach this if the line exceeds the recommended word limit per line?

@Incogdino I am calling other methods for the assertions that are calling them to check that the post conditions are correct so that if the original guarding method was changed incorrectly, the assertion would pick it up. 
However, using too many asserts makes the code look quite long and untidy, although without much performance isues. Therefore, I was wondering where to draw the line.

> I feel that some of the asserts may not be necessary here because other classes like model has its own defensive checks. E.g. If you try to add a duplicated person to the model, the UniquePersonList will throw an exception.

I agree. Most of our methods already have their own defensive checks. So I am unsure as to when an assert statement will actually be helpful.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Should similar bugs under planned enhancements be considered NotInScope?**
</div>

<img width="716" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d34bc17-c8c6-4bb8-8c7a-75198f15a131">

### **Context**:
- **Current Behavior**: Names containing substrings like `m/`, `a/`, or `e/` are misinterpreted as field prefixes, causing parsing errors.
- **Planned Enhancement**: The DG enhancement explicitly mentions fixing the issue for `m/`, but no similar mention exists for `a/` or `e/`.


### **Description**:

As shown in the screenshot above, our planned enhancements section in the DG explicitly states that the application will support names containing prefixes like `m/` as part of the name field (e.g., `n/John m/Doe`). This enhancement aims to prevent the parser from misinterpreting substrings like `m/` as the `major` prefix.

However, we have received **two related bug reports** regarding other prefixes (`a/` for address, `e/` for email) that are currently **not allowed in names**. These issues were not explicitly mentioned in the planned enhancements.

**Questions:**
1. Do these related issues qualify as part of the planned enhancement scope, given their similarity to the documented `m/` prefix enhancement since we think that they are duplicate bugs that can be fixed together at once?
2. Should we classify these issues as **"NotInScope"** or reject the bugs since they are mentioned in the planned enhancements section?

**2. :fas-info-circle: MarkBind website not working**

Hi, I'm facing a bug where the layout for my markbind website for my User Guide isn't showing up properly( missing sidebars, navigation bar, and wrong fonts) as seen in the [first picture](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t17-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) below.

I think you can try checking if you have multiple data files in your directory that might store two different task lists. As in the image below, the correct data file should be under the `ip/data` folder and not `ip/src/main/java/cleo/data`. I'm not sure how i got he second data folder before but this could be a possibility!

I know for Interfaces, the default visibility in Java is set to `public` for its methods, does the same rule apply for abstract methods in abstract classes as well, regards to Java's default visibility when it was not specified in the question?

Just to check, for this question here, the reason why `b` is not the right answer is because of the highlighted part of the question where they are referencing to that particular association? Cause the second photo shows the textbook stating an example that looks exactly the same but with bi-directional navigability (2nd photo). Wanted to confirm if the reason this was wrong is because the question is referencing specifically to the yellow highlighted part.

**5. :fas-info-circle: Association Classes vs Dependencies**
</div>

Hi just wanted to clarify what the main difference is between Association Classes and Dependencies:

From my understanding, Dependencies are classes that does not store a reference to any other classes but relies on other classes to perform certain tasks and association is referred to classes that does in fact store references to other classes.

The following is a quote from the lecture notes on the course website that I have pasted for reference:
> Dependencies vs associations:
> 
> An association is a relationship resulting from one object keeping a reference to another object (i.e., storing an object in an instance variable). While such a relationship forms a dependency, we need not show that as a dependency arrow in the class diagram if the association is already indicated in the diagram. That is, showing a dependency arrow does not add any value to the diagram.
>
> Similarly, an inheritance results in a dependency from the child class to the parent class but we don't show it as a dependency arrow either, for the same reason as above.
>
> Use a dependency arrow to indicate a dependency only if that dependency is not already captured by the diagram in another way (for instance, as an association or an inheritance) e.g., class Foo accessing a constant in Bar but there is no association/inheritance from Foo to Bar.


My question is, in the photo pasted below for reference, doesn't the association class act like a dependency class as well? It does not store any references of other classes as shown in the example, rather just a utility base Class to store just a `startDate` and `returnDate` in example.

Dependencies:

**6. :fas-info-circle: Issue regarding JUnit / Gradle Build dependencies**
</div>

# JUnit / Gradle Build Dependency issue

Hi I keep on getting this same error message when trying to run JUnit:

```
error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
                            &hat;
```

It pops up under Build Output, I have double check my Gradle dependencies to make sure that it is using the right JUnit dependencies, it is, but not sure where to go from here.

```java
dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
``}``
```

I searched online and one suggestion was to click the reload all Gradle projects button found in the Gradle menu. That ended up turning my `@Test` annotation red, along with the following imports turning to grey and the words "Test" and "Assertions" turning red, which I am guessing those are needed but somehow removed perhaps?

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class UiTest ``{``
    @Test
```

My development environment details are as follows:
- MacOS
- SDK: Azul zulu version 17.0.11 arch64

Here is a screenshot of what I meant:

Hi prof, I tried the first bullet point but, it did not fix the issue.

However, I think I know where I went wrong. I attempted the second bullet point and copied and pasted my Test.java code, so if I understand correctly, I think when typing the @Test annotation, and how automatically Java asks if you would like to add JUnit. I may have selected "Add JUnit 5.8.1 to class path", which I am guessing might be the cause of the issue since I am suppose to use JUnit 5.10.

However, in my clone fork, after clicking on the @Test, the only options I am given for resolving are as follows:
- Add JUnit 4 to class path
- Add JUnit 5.8.1 to class path
- Add testing to class path
- Create another test
- Change access modifier
- Try to resolve class reference

There isn't any option specifically for JUnit 5.10.0

Yup I agree with the previous comment, you can look at Parser being solely responsible for processing the input. You can reference the example provided in `run()` under `A-MoreOOP Stretch Goal`. Notice how it is receiving a `String fullCommand` that you can get from the `ui` instance. After which it then returns an instance of `Command c` in this case. The `Ui` class for me is solely responsible for receiving inputs and printing outputs.

For me personally, I decided to use `Enums` with my `Parser` Class to match the string inputs to the range of commands that exist, though I am sure there are better ways to do this.

Ahh I see, so dependencies are just relationships rather than looked at as a class itself. I thought a Dependency Class was an actual thing, similar to an Association Class.

With that being said the Association Class itself has a dependency relationship to the other classes they are linked to, just that they represent the association itself. So based on the examples shown above, `Loan` represents the association between `Student` borrowing `Book` where as `PreviewGenerator` does not represent any association, but is mainly there just to perform certain operations making it dependent on other classes, the key point here would be that in that example, `PreviewGenerator` does not represent any association relationship but is dependent on `Chapter`, whereas `Loan` represents the association relationship between `Student` and `Book` and thus also making it dependent to both of those classes as well?

Would this be correct?

For me personally the way I did it was adding on an if statement in their `handleUserInput()` method as referenced in their tutorial notes by checking if the `String response` that you get from your `getResponse()` method from your `Duke` instance contains the word `Bye`, I just added something like the following:

```java
// Stop the JavaFX application from running after bye command
if (response.contains("Bye")) ``{``
    Platform.exit();
``}``
```

After looking at the reasonings you gave, they are the same ones I came to as well. I think they are correct too. I could not find in the textbook if it was explicitly said that Composition is optional (for point A), however, I went back to the lecture videos to clarify, under the course website, `week 4`, `Class-Diagrams Intermediate Level`, watch the video by prof at the `4:43 min` mark, he mentions the following and I quote:
> These things (Composition and Aggregation) are what we add to an association to provide additional information
> Even without adding them, the diagram is still correct.

Hope this helps :)

@emmannyyy I don't think removing brackets around an if statement would be considered improving the code to make it more readable. If anything it might make it worse in the context of Java.

I honestly had this same question as well. I think the real reason is less complicated than we think it is, I think the question was just trying to test us on which option changes the external behaviour. If you were to look for the model answer in A2 for that question, it just states, `it changes the behaviour`. 

But with that being said you raised a good point, because by definition, Refactoring means: `Improve internal structure without changing external behaviour`. Technically, while removing brackets do not change the external behaviour, it is not explicitly: `improving internal structure without changing external behaviour` either. If anything it sounds like you edited your Java code by making it less readable. Not too sure if I myself may have misunderstood the concept or question.

I also agree with the above answers, perhaps a visual explanation might help too. If you refer to the textbook, they have a list of common multiplicity, attached below for reference as the photo. If your multiplicity is `1`, it means it is `compulsory`, and it must be linked to the object at `all times`. The photo below is a handy guide when it comes to referencing multiplicity.

Interesting question, I tried answering this myself while referencing the definition of statement coverage as attached below. If let's say, their definition of `execution of code` is something like how each line is running, something like the IntelliJ debugging step tool. I think the answer might be `3`. The smallest test case I can think of would be a string with length 0, `String s == ""` but not a string that is `null`.

Then I think line 1, 2, 6 will be executed. But the program does nothing afterwards, because of the for loop condition. If the string was null, then the lines of code executed would be 4, which would be line 1, 2, 3, 4, which would not be the smallest lines of code.

I am not sure if this is correct or if I myself misunderstood the concept/question. But this was what I came up with. Hope this helps :)

If I am not wrong I think it also applies as well, which means the only main difference is just that for implementation of interface you have a dashed line rather a single line for inheritance. The photo below is from the textbook stating only difference is just the line itself. Hope this helps :)

Here is my take on this, I think it is just command pattern, but not for the reason mentioned above. Mainly because of the fact that History does not have any notification method or any way to notify the obervers. Referencing the attached image below in the textbook, keywords here are `interested in being notified`. History Class does not have that.

<img width="728" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-26 at 9 00 23 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf912047-4f08-4cde-9099-d693a605917a">

@emmannyyy In regards to your response, regarding the paragraph:
> Since this History class did not observe the Actions ActionX and ActionY by implementing an interface, I believe this doesn't closely match the observer pattern anymore. (History only manages to keep track of ActionX and ActionY via directly having a list of Repeatables).

In the part where you mentioned because it did not implement an interface, I don't think that is a requirement for observer, cause if you notice in the reference image from the textbook, StudentList also did not implement the Obersever, rather it is just associated with it for its `addUi()` method. So technically it does not need to implement the interface, however, I also don't think it is considered observer for the point I mentioned above. Hope this helps :)

I have just done debugging myself.:) Is it because my terminal is using a different version of java from java 17 at first? I was forced to download javaFX manually and update the path to JavaFX SDK manually as well.

Yes I have resolved it on MAC OS Monterey version 12.3. I went through a complicated process as I used a different version from the precise JDK 17 version as recommended. 

Later I switched to the specific Azul JDK 17 in the guide, everything became easy. Thanks a lot!

If your terminal is using Java19, there's a chance your current `$JAVA_HOME` points to that particular version of Java instead of the one you have to use, and it might be beneficial to change that for the rest of the module, at the very least.

Yep you are right! I modified ~/.zshrc file to set my $JAVA_HOME variable later. By the way, SDKMAN is quite good at managing the version of Java.

> @Ma-Xizi evaluating your own code quality (and the level of testing) is among things we hope you'll learn in this course. We did give you some automated feedback on code quality to get you started but from then on you'll need to manage it yourself. So, you can make a judgement call on how much is enough. Later on, during the iP evaluation (which has a peer evaluation), you'll also get to evaluate the code quality and testing level of other iPs. This should serve as more practice. That said, we'll still give you some further code quality feedback later, after the iP is over. That will help you identify the things you missed yourself, and do an even better job in the tP.

> 1. To answer your question, if done correctly, the team repo and forks will be identical, with or without feature branches. That is, you need to synchronize them by pulling from the team repo, and pushing to your fork.

Great tip! Another approach I found is to consider using the [try-with-resources statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html). This statement automatically manages the closing of resources, such as FileWriter and other types that implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable` or `java.io.Closeable`. 

By using try-with-resources, we can ensure that your file writers, scanners, and other resources are closed automatically at the end of the statement, even if an exception occurs. This can save time and prevent bugs related to resource management.

Here’s a quick example:
```java
try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("output.txt")) ``{``
    // File Writing Logic Line 1
    // File Writing Logic Line 2
    // Code ...
    // File Writing Logic Line n
``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
    e.printStackTrace();
``}``
```

This way, there might not be a need to explicitly call fileWriter.close(), and it makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.

In this case VScode isnt allowed then. And even Apple's notes default notes app with icloud sharing. Actually even microsoft word allows online collaboration...

I think students definitely understand that collaboration features aren’t allowed, and invigilators should be there to ensure compliance. However, the question of whether software with AI tools or plugins is permissible remains unclear and may require additional clarification.

In part 2 of the mock exam, there is a box for typing text which is not required in this section of the exam as it involves us writing on paper. However, I am not able to find a way to minimise it which makes the viewport for the question text very small. Does anyone know how to minimise it for the actual exam tomorrow? Thanks!

</div>

In CS2030 (the version taught by Prof Henry Chia) he advocates for all objects to be made immutable. For eg. if you want to change a `Task` object from being not-done to done, you should return a `new Task` rather than by modifying the boolean attribute tracking the "doneness" of the task. This makes the coding "safer" as there's no risk of accidentally changing the state / value of objects during runtime, but also makes it harder to program as the object changes after each state change (and the new object needs to slot into the place of the old one).

I would consider this a magical literal as it is not too clear what context in which this message is sent. Especially since the method is `execute` and not `sort`, is it not _too_ self-explanatory that this method should sort and print out a corresponding message. 

The way I would think of it is this - if I were to write this in a company and later leave the company, the next person working on the codebase should understand what to put there and change the message if necessary should the `execute` function change in its output / functionality later 🙂 

Though, happy to hear what others might think of this!

The website says "Only merged branches are detected by the script" if I do not do "Compare and pull request" then merge the branches in the pull request, will the script detect that I merge the branches using Git CLI on my local computer?

So the steps are
1. push your branch to github branch
2. merge branch to master on your computer
3. push the merge commit on master to github master
4. Leave the branch alone, don't delete it

Is this the correct process ?

Okay Prof I messed up my branching big time, I forgot I was in branch-Level-7 when creating branch-Level-8 as I use Git from the CLI, so I am not actively shown which branch I am in, and now changing the commit history to ensure it fits the correct branching is too difficult for me already. 

Will I be penalised, and can I keep my current code, if not I have to reset to Level-6 and restart branch-Level-7 and branch-Level-8 again? 

Will the scripts detect the branches and merges correctly, i.e "Only merged branches are detected by the script" will this statement be satisfied

Is this what you mean when you say "merging of the branches is reflected in the repo"? Otherwise, how should we know if the merging is reflected in the repo, and the scripts will be able to detect the merge branches

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question about the practice exam part 1 [p1.05]**
</div>

Hi,  I have 2 questions regarding this question.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/711d0ed8-4095-4234-b31a-07febb00b2fc)

1) In the diagram given in the question, does the diagram have an error? I thought that the process() method should be labelled as ``{``abstract``}``, as seen in the text book

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dda0d2b8-f921-4783-adb8-05252e41e62b)

2) Does anyone know why option 4 is the correct answer but not option 2? My initial reasoning for selecting option 2 is because `process()` is the only method in the abstract class `Foo`, so I assumed that `process()` is an abstract method. So if there is a solid arrow from `Bar` to `Foo`, it means that `Bar` inherits from `Foo`, and could possibly have an implementation of the abstract method `process()`. So it would cause a compile error.

On the other hand, option 4 seems to be a valid statement (incorrect answer), just like how an object can be of type List but implements and Arraylist?

Hi Prof, 

In the course briefing video this week, one of the questions you provided as an exam like question was:
```Is the Unified process iterative or sequential?```

However the textbook categorised the topic, "Can explain the Unified Process" as 4 stars.

May I clarify if we are expected to know the unified process?

AB3 Tutorial: Adding a Command

Hi, 

I was going through the "**AB3 Tutorial: Adding a Command**", under section "**Enhancing `RemarkCommand`**", and I clicked the [link](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/dc6d5139d08f6403da0ec624ea32bd79a2ae0cbf#diff-a8e35af8f9c251525063fae36c9852922a7e7195763018eacec60f3a4d87c594) at the bottom of the section. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77838e56-2b27-4945-95f0-20b03fa0afdb)

Clicking the link brought me to this page, showing the changed that needed to be made for the section.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c7c77b3-0893-4b7b-8acc-bed445d0fee7)

In the import statements above, I noticed this line:

```
import static seedu.address.commons.core.Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT;
```

This line caused an error because Messages was not found in the logic package.
When I checked the AB3 code, there doesn't seem to have the Messages class either.
Instead, following the intellij suggestion, I replaced the above line with this line:

```
import static seedu.address.logic.Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT;
```

It seems to work when I run the code, at least up till my current section.

May I check if anyone encountered this issue before and if it is ok to make such a replacement?

Hi,

Might anyone know what I could have done wrongly when I commit and push to my remote repo? 

On the dashboard it displayed that I have only completed Level-4, when I had also completed those beforehand.

I used source tree, and pushed to both the master branch and origin branch of my remote server for Level-4. I checked and ensured that the tags are named correctly. I think I only pushed to master for the previous levels. On my github repo, master is my main branch.

My current code is as such:

##my code
```ruby
public class Bob ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        String logo = "____________________________________________________________\n" 
            + "Hello! I'm Bob\n"
            + "What can I do for you?\n"
            + "____________________________________________________________\n"
            + "Bye. Hope to see you again soon!\n"
            + "____________________________________________________________\n";
        System.out.println(logo);
    ``}``
``}``
```

I want to remove the first 2 lines but I am unsure how. If anyone could help, that will be much appreciated, thanks!

Hello, I think that based on the textbook, abstraction should help to show details that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand need to be considered. This involves concealing the implementation of methods so that it is simple for us understanding the method at a high enough level of abstraction.

For example, a `process()` method may involve adding and saving. We do not need to put the entire implementation of `add()` or `save()` in the same method, `process()`.

I still don't quite understand why is it an invalid statement though, since its 'Bar' has overridden ~Foo' and implemented 'process()'

i was trying to undo a commit as i had named it wrongly using this instruction:

In the next dialog, choose the mode Mixed - keep working copy but reset index option. This will make the offending commit disappear but will keep the changes that you included in that commit intact."

however i then pushed and now my work done on intellij is also back to the previous commit, without all my recent work.
 is there any way to get it back :(

Why does the FC command in the bat file highlight my text art as differing in the expected and actual file? I copied it from my output and put in the expected text. 

it would appear there are some missing spaces in some lines of the expected.txt which are in the Actual.txt but if I copy them over to the expected text they disappear after I run the runtest.bat.
Any ideas on how to fix this would be appreciated!

Immutability is for safe sharing of object internals between classes (keeps them safe from any changes), idt there's any need for that at this stage of the project however as the mostly likely implementation of duke is using switch statements.

the error handling also appears to be complete in the command line output but within the UI it only states invalid without specifying whats wrong, not sure if this is intended.

Task can only navigate to the Repeatable class not the Action class as seen from the method signature of in the Class diagram being Task(Repeatable Task), what the actual type of the Task is isn't reflected since it is taken in as a Repeatable. This is different from an object diagram where we just directly show what object is being put inside since clarifying it is identified as a Repeatable in the :Task would be extremely messy and confusing as it might be interpreted as a new object rather than the same one but identified as a different a Type

Composition allows 0 since it's only a one-way thing. The parent Class may or may not have it's children-Class(es) but the child classes Cannot exist without the parent class

**3. :fas-info-circle: Clarity of Sort Order for Sort Command**
</div>

Our application accepts any characters for name. A bug is stating that we should have clarified the order for names entered in Chinese characters in the UG. However, this feels overburdening on our end because we have to explain all possible orderings. I had mentioned in the ug:
<img width="605" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54899799-2797-491b-baf9-c50eaffc8833">

Note: The generally is in bold because it is possible the special characters follow the English letters which was the case for the Chinese characters. 

I am unclear on whether or not the user has a point. In particular, I am not sure how obvious we must make the sort order, but my initial judgement is that the explanation is sufficient. I feel since we mentioned the general order and that the user can understand how the ordering works by seeing the results this bug can be considered out of scope or rejected.

Another consideration or angle of thought is that we assumed the use of English characters by default, but we never explicitly stated this. The bug reporter mentioned that allowing Chinese characters is important because there are people who may not have english versions of their names, but I am inclined to reject this line of reasoning because it is always possible to translate names.

From the tp grading guidelines, a team is expected to place 50% of AB3 implementation effort. We are also told that a student should put 50% of the effort it takes to do an IP. So if you have 5 students you would expect 2.5 IP effort. However, 2.5 IP effort doesn't seem to be anywhere near 50% AB3 effort. 50% AB3 effort feels more like 5 IPs. Since these metrics feel so different which should we follow?

**6. :fas-info-circle: Clarification regarding TP UML diagrams**
</div>

For week 10 tp progress we are expected to modify the UML diagrams in accordance to our changes. The changes I made were allowing multiple deletion and creating a SortCommand that sorts the addressbook. To do these changes I only created new PersonComparator and IndexComparator classes. These classes have nowhere to be placed in the current DG. 

However, it seems we are expected to make a change anyways, so how shall I proceed? In particular, looking at the criteria it is bad to include to much information in the DG, so it maybe inadvisable to create a diagram just for the sake of showing diagram skills. On that note, I also want to ask if the AB3 DG diagrams are considered comprehensive or if there are things to be added (neglecting features added by us).

I believe the coding guidelines don't specify that the override statement should be its own line. However, conventionally override is placed above the method like in the 2nd example. I think either method is valid as far as standards for the course, but override being a separate line is better for readability.

I think you can correct this by forking your team's repo now and then cloning your fork. 

To do a PR push changes to your fork. When you go to your fork on github website it will suggest creating a PR. You can click on that, if it doesn't suggest can read back material on how to create a PR. 

Even if you do not fork the repo you should still be able to create a PR but the PR will be from a branch to main branch in the main repo. This is called the feature workflow whereby all team members push to branches in the main repo while working and then create a PR from that branch to main. However, until tp V1.3 we are meant to follow the forking workflow so for now just fork and flow the forking workflow.

The activation bar has been omitted in the drawing. It is not a requirement to show the activation bar. If they were to show it, it would start at c.

If you follow the diagram UI widget extends the abstract class progresswatcher which implements the watcher interface. The activity has references to the watcher. Since UI widget is a watcher, the activity will have a reference to it and not the other way around. There is no way to navigate from the UI widget to the activities because it doesn't contain references to activities. The activity does have a reference to UI widget because it has a list of watchers (and UI widget is a watcher). The question phrasing is likely intentionally trying to throw you off.

> In CS2030 (the version taught by Prof Henry Chia) he advocates for all objects to be made immutable. For eg. if you want to change a `Task` object from being not-done to done, you should return a `new Task` rather than by modifying the boolean attribute tracking the "doneness" of the task. This makes the coding "safer" as there's no risk of accidentally changing the state / value of objects during runtime, but also makes it harder to program as the object changes after each state change (and the new object needs to slot into the place of the old one).

Prof Chia himself says that the extremely strict immutability is only a requirement for teaching purposes, and that in many real-life scenarios complete and absolute immutability is unergonomic, unperformant and possibly even unattainable at the systems level.

I think it depends on the context, but 'E' and 'F' are not really adjacent in any sense other than ascii code (and I don't think it's common to use the ascii code form in a for-loop for example), so I couldn't consider them boundaries.

Yup, it works maximized (for the linked constraints) but the default window size (basically default `preferences.json` generated on fresh uhh start of app haha)  is that a certain box gets cropped so much the information inside isn't visible.

My question is if it is a valid bug since the workaround is to maximize the screen, even though there are alternative and what I feel are better solutions to this (e.g. minHeight) and that a user should be expected to use the app at the default dimensions, or at least have indication that they will need to maximize it, but I'm not sure...

I think the path coverage option feels a lot more correct than the facebook one, which is quite ambigious

like to build a facebook competitor, the app will need to be huge and complex given how many features facebook has, so it sounds hard/unfeasible to develop in one-shot sequentially, not to mention you are developing a competitor, so it needs to be better than facebook (how? add novel features probably i.e. iterative)

path coverage in many cases is much harder to achieve than statement, and can be illustrated with even a simple example like in the textbook, so id put my money on that option

</div>

I would like to 'turn off' the css property that changes the text color of the words in the commandTextField to red, when an unknown command is typed in by the user. 
In CommandBox.java, when the command raises an exception, ```setStyleToIndicateCommandFailure()``` is called, which essentially adds ```ERROR_STYLE_CLASS = "error"``` to the styleClass of the commandTextField. 
Inside DarkTheme.css, there is a block of code which i can only assume to be controlling this behaviour based on the text fill color of red. However, when i commented out this block of code, the behaviour does not change (i.e., the text still turns red when an unknown command is typed into the command box) How can i turn this behavior off and what controls it? Thanks!
```
#commandTypeLabel ``{``
    -fx-font-size: 11px;
    -fx-text-fill: #F70D1A;     /*(this color is red)*/

I agree with the previous comment, maybe try saving it to a different folder instead. And perhaps you could also check if your program is reading the .txt file from the correct location (if there is already an existing list of tasks).

@damithc Hi prof, is there any way to fix this? I dont wish for this to be a problem in the future. Something that I thought might cause this issue is that my nus email is linked to raynerlimfangyuh account and my own gmail is linked to my current rayray39 account.
However, in git, using `git config --global user.email` the email is my nus email while the name is rayray39. Could this be the cause? And will it be solved if i change the git email to my own gmail account?

Hi prof @damithc , thanks for the feedback. But why would the user want to keep track of things that is already over? Wouldnt it make more sense for the user to only keep track of deadlines that are in the future? (eg. upcoming assignments, approaching meetings etc.)?

At the end of my runtest.bat file, pause was added to keep the runtest.bat file open. However, after adding gradle into my project, running the .bat file closes it immediately.

What is the reason for this and is there any available way to keep the file open so i can review if there are possible differences?

This worked. My environment variable was indeed set to another JDK version. Thanks for the help Prof!

In the application I tested, their UG mentioned that they disallow same names and /, @, ' in names. Can I list this as a bug even though they have stated it in their UG? 

Because I feel that many people have such names and it will be a huge inconvenience for users if same names are not allowed. I was thinking also if this should be severity.LOW or severity.MEDIUM. Will be open to any opinions!

hm, i made my build.gradle file exactly the same as yours, but I am still facing the same issue. Is it possible that the problem is coming from a file that is not build.gradle?

i think your references by arrow is the wrong direction? in the questions it says: 

A Handout can be referenced by the text in any number of Brochures.

the arrow should be the other way?

Basically, all of the sequence diagram arrowheads we encountered in this course are the first type. Does it mean that if we see a sequence diagram in the exam with the _lined arrowhead_, we can assume it is the _filled_ one?

The following is the diagram I screenshotted from one of the Week 8's videos.

As per the textbook,

I am wondering when it is not omitted, is it still correct if the Object diagram doesn't show certain values?

Let's take the **Additional practice questions for part 2** as an example:
```java
class Handout extends Document ``{`` 
    public List<Brochure> referenced; 
    private List<Section> sections; 
    protected boolean isFull; 
    private int page = 0; 
    String heading; 
    // ...
 ``}``
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31838501-d51d-46f1-a2b1-ec2a88665524)
Is this compliant with the code? (The `Handout` object doesn't show the values of `isFull = false` and `page = 0`)

Here is a tip on how you can write your product description using Markdown...

You can use **badges** to provide visual information on your
- Project version
- Build status
- License type
- Test coverage
- Dependencies or vulnerabilities

Here is an example for __project version__:
``[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2-yellow.svg)](https://semver.org)``
will return this
[![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2-yellow.svg)](https://semver.org)

To know more about GitHub Markdown Badges, you guys can refer to [this link](https://daily.dev/blog/github-markdown-badges-explained).

Your app handles all the errors beautifully. It looks nice on my side also! I like how you tailor your app with a logo and a full-screen interface.

The C-Help extension is elegant and easy to understand. However, can try putting a link to the User Guide or providing more details on the `date` format. It is unclear at first, user can only know how to if they make at least 1 mistake.

In case you want to improve the error handling, you can consider unable the "Enter" and "Pressing Send button" actions when the TextField is empty!

Another thing, I don't know if it can be considered a bug based on the project requirement.

When I added a task, for example, a `todo` task by adding a few *spaces* after the command word `todo`, the current version still accepted it and did not consider it the wrong format. Same thing happened to `deadline` and `event` also.

This is my screenshot

**5. :fas-info-circle: How to change a commit message ?**
</div>

After reading week 3 content, I try to change my commit messages to follow the git convention rules. I google for the instructions, and it told me to right click the commit and choose rebase ...However, somehow it seems to create a new branch, instead of only change the commit message. Do you guys have other ways ?

While editing the configuration for runtest.sh, I don't know what to put in the "interpreter path". I try leave that blank and run the program, my computer only opened another software to show me the code of runtest.sh. How I can fix this problem. Thank you.
My OS is Window and I am using Intellij.

Well it doesn't work because somehow, the app doesn't recognise the interpreter

By the way, this is more detail of how to do it with SourceTree:
1. Create (if you haven't had one) Personal Access Token that allows `workflow` in github.
2. Navigate to Repository -&gt; Repository Settings and change the URL of `origin` from 
`https://github.com/&lt;your_git_hubname>/ip.git`
to `https://&lt;The_Personal_Access_Token_key>@github.com/&lt;your_github_name>/ip.git`
You can see The_Personal_Access_Token_key after create the token.

To add on,

> Consequently, is it okay for me to have a PrintUtils class in a utils package that contains only static methods that are used for outputting message to the user?

It is probably okay if the project size is small. However, if the project gets more complicated with many packages, then it might not be wise to extract all message printing methods into the same place as it violates the modulization principle.

> Will this affects encapsulation of the class?

This is a actually good point I did not consider.

Searching online, there is a highly upvoted stackoverflow question that discusses this problem, here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34571/how-do-i-test-a-class-that-has-private-methods-fields-or-inner-classes

I found one comment by Colin M which I found convincing, that says
> By testing private methods you are testing the implementation. This defeats the purpose of unit testing, which is to test the inputs/outputs of a class' contract.

So I guess in your specific situation, instead of trying to test directly on private fields of TaskList, you may test through its exposed interfaces (there should be some public method like getTask()). 

That said, it is just my immature idea. If anyone has a different opinion or approach, please feel free to comment below!

Just to add on:
When performing an auto reformat, IntelliJ by default collapses import from the same package as one single wildcard import when the number reaches 5 (which violates CS2103T coding standard). For example,
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.TreeMap;
```
will be auto-reformatted to 
```java
import java.util.*;
```

To suppress this behaviour, go to File > Settings > Code Style > Java > Imports, set the two values in the rectangle to 9999.

<img width="738" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d2e593d-2f40-458a-993f-46e8ab37942d">

If you want to limit the scope of this supression within the project only, you can change the scheme on top to Project before making the above changes. This way, other IntelliJ projects won't be affected and will still auto-collapse imports.

When I was reading the quoted statement I was quite confused as why two classes with no references to each other can still be associated. It seems to me that such an 'association' is meaningless, as the code wouldn't change whether the association exists or not (since no attributes are added).

I was more perplexed when I read an earlier statement:

> An association can be shown as an attribute instead of a line.

This suggests that an association should result in new attributes being created, which makes it navigable.

This leads me to the question: do associations without navigability actually exist, and if so, what are some real-life examples where such associations are necessary and meaningful?

@damithc Got it! I now realize that I misunderstood the text. A more accurate interpretation is that associations imply navigability, and vice versa, though navigability can be either unidirectional or bidirectional (or simply not shown). 
Please correct me if my understanding is still wrong/inaccurate.

Hello! I've tested on Windows and I would say it's an excellent product!

One suggestion I have is to consider making your `find` command case-insensitive. This allows more flexibility and will make the command even more useful.

I really love how the dialog box changes color for different commands!

Hi, Windows user here! It works well for me. Just some minor edge case issues:
- The `list` message when the tasklist is empty contains a typo (Sire -&gt; Sir)
- The program crashes on `deadline` and `event` commands with empty description or date

You might want to make your parser more robust and display error messages in such situations. 

Apart from these, great job! 👍  The archive feature is really helpful when the task list becomes messy.

Windows user here. The GUI opens up fine on my laptop and all the features work as intended! I noted some edge cases that could be handled more elegently:
- A more user-friendly message can be displayed for wrong date format;
- Currently having slashes in the description will lead to an exception message being displayed. Maybe you can display 'please remove slashes in your task description' instead?

By the way, there's a misplaced slash in the deadline command format section of the user guide.

That said, overall it's an excellent product!

Im not sure how to settle this issue and I cant seem to debug the code either way

Also, the second problem I am having is that the src/test/java/seedu.address/commons/util/AppUtilTest keeps on getting an error when I run the ```gradle build``` command. This is the specific line of code I get the error from

```
public class AppUtilTest ``{``

    public void getImage_exitingImage() ``{``
        assertNotNull(AppUtil.getImage("/images/address_book_32.png"));

When I follow the steps on the CS2103 website on opening AddressBook, I get an error at step 4

Here is the instructions from the CS2103 website:

Quick start
1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest .jar file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar addressbook.jar command to run the application.
A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

```

Thank you all for your help once again but after thinking a bit, it may be due to the runtest.sh being a feature for the previous weeks without the GUI requirement. Hence my main class now is the Launcher class instead of the Winde class. Maybe this is the issue? Or maybe when I changed my GitHub personal token and had to sign into my GitHub account on IntelliJ again it detected that I had this error whenever I push new commits. 


Anyways this issue doesn't really affect my end product of my iP (jar file) and so I think I will just close this issue. It is just annoying that everytime I push a commit I get this email saying my JAVA CI workflow has an issue.

Thanks so much prof!

Also gonna leave this here for anyone else also having trouble for the Second part of the tp tutorial of Week 6

I still got some error when doing the ```./gradlew check``` so this is what I did to rectify this issue:

Change the toStringMethod() of test/java/seedu/address/model/person/PersonTest.java to be the following. It should be on line 93.

```
    @Test
    public void toStringMethod() ``{``
        String expected = Person.class.getCanonicalName() + "``{``name=" + ALICE.getName() + ", phone=" + ALICE.getPhone()
                + ", email=" + ALICE.getEmail() + ", address=" + ALICE.getAddress() + ", remark=" + ALICE.getRemark()
                + ", tags=" + ALICE.getTags() + "``}``";
        assertEquals(expected, ALICE.toString());
    ``}``
```

Second thing is to comment out the entire last method of test/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPersonTest.java. The method is toModelType_invalidTags_throwsIllegalValueException()

Only then do I get no errors for doing ```./gradlew check```

Maybe there's a better way to do it @damithc ?

Hi prof, I would like to add a bit more details to this as I am also having the same issue (alongside other mac users in my group)

The only diagrams that show up are the following:
UndoSequenceDiagram.puml

ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml
UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic and Model

The rest look like the screenshot shown above.

@damithc Prof, Im using Mac Preview to access my pdf readers and it worked fine when I was doing the practice papers and the mock exam. Will this be the case for the actual exam as well or is it still recommended to use adobe?

Or is it because of the invigilation requirements that we're only supposed to use Adobe?

Thank you both, @damithc and @arjun2598, for your input. 

However, I need clarification on how to edit an older commit. It seems like this might involve rebasing, but I'm a bit uncertain about the process and concerned about the potential impact on my entire project. 

Could you please provide detailed steps for rebasing? Alternatively, would it be better to leave the commit messages as it is?

Ok Thankyou so much @JoanneHing @damithc @arjun2598 for your inputs.

I have edited my commits using `git commit --amend -c &lt;commitID>`.
The only downside to it is that our branch gets diverged then we have to do:
* git pull origin master
* git push (Introducing 2 more commits including the updated commit message).

@RezwanAhmed123 , 
As per my understanding, the totalScore refers to that particular player only not for the players all together, hence it would vary from player to player. 
totalScore being the total score of an individual player(state of a specific object instance), it is better managed at instance level therefore, it cannot be a class level member.

@damithc Correct this if I am wrong.

The system import statements are separated by their groups / packages in [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/index.html#package-and-import-statements), should we do the same for custom import statements, i.e. follow option 1 instead of option 2?

May be helpful:
If you are on Windows machine, run runtest.bat in */text-ui-test/ directory, and you **will not** expecting "Test result: PASSED" or "Test result: FAILED" outputs, you will only see the output from FC command.
If your are on *nix machine, run runtest.sh in */text-ui-test/ directory, and you **will** be expecting to see "Test result: PASSED" or "Test result: FAILED" outputs.
The 2 scripts are written differently, so they will not print the same set of outputs.

One use case can be using varargs for command parameter. E.g., event 123 /from startDate /to endDate, you can set the parameter for your command object constructor as String..., and you will use the constructor by passing "event", "123", "startDate", "endDate" as the parameters.

Hi Prof, it has been 2 days and no one else has a answer for my last comment. May I just clarify do we stick to https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html **strictly**, i.e. I should not put blank lines between custom import (to separate the imports by my packages) because these imports belongs to "all other imports"? If I follow the style strictly, is it fine if my custom imports look like this (note, these imports are in my Parser class, which requires all command objects and handle exceptions):

```
import command.ByeCommand;
import command.Command;
import command.DeadlineCommand;
import command.DeleteCommand;
import command.EventCommand;
import command.FindCommand;
import command.ListCommand;
import command.MarkCommand;
import command.TodoCommand;
import command.UnmarkCommand;
import exception.BlitzCommandDoesNotExistException;
import exception.BlitzException;
import exception.BlitzInvalidParameterMoreThanOneException;
import exception.BlitzInvalidParameterRegexException;
import exception.BlitzNoParameterException;

> @gohsl99 Yes, the easiest solution seems to be to just remove the blank line. But you may change the checkstyle configuration too, if you wish. If you do the latter, you are likely to run into the same issue in the tP, and you'll need the team's consensus to change the checkstyle config.

You may want to indicate there is nothing in the list instead of current implementation when you run "list" on empty text file / first time running the program. The rest works fine.

Able to run on Windows 11.

1. You may consider to catch the error `... could not be parsed at index 4` and print `OOPS!!! ...` instead.

Ah, I initially took a similar approach, validating both user inputs and file inputs directly within the task subclasses. However, I found that this caused the subclasses to become quite lengthy, as I was checking and parsing both file and user input within each class. In my case, I didn't have a shared parser method across all subclasses—each class had its own method for validation and parsing, which might have been the core issue. Did you encounter something similar? How did you handle it and overcome this problem?

I do agree even if this doesn't technically violate LoD, it would violate the idea of LoD.

Would making `compareName()` a method in `Person` be better then? My main concern with regards to doing this is if it will be violating Single Responsibility Principle for `Person` or should this question be left to another thread.

Thanks for the suggestion! Implementing Comparable with the `compareTo()` method for name comparison is definitely a straightforward approach. However, in my case, I need more flexibility because I want to compare `Person` objects based on different attributes, such as `name`, or other fields, depending on the context.

I see your point about SRP. In this case, I’m essentially using `Person` as a means to access its properties for comparison, without introducing new responsibilities. Would that be what you mean @zaidansani?

@Judy1x4 Hi. I suspect what happened is that you committed those 2 files before updating your .gitignore. So those files will continue being tracked despite specifically updating to ignore it afterwards.

What you can do is:
1. first commit all current changes (to be safe)
2. run ```git rm --cached build.gradle data/jude.txt``` 
3. commit 

And hopefully it works!

Hi. Please correct me if I get this wrong :p
Q1) I would say yes? No specific rules are broken from (a) due to the lack of information.

Q2) n...m notation you can think of it as a range from n to m (inclusive). So for the given example:

- Every Main object can have 1 to * (any number) of Person objects. Since the minimum is 1, you can also read this as "1 or more".
- For Person object its not specified, so I don't know if you can just assume it be 1 by default, because you should consider the possibility of setting references to `null`.

Personally, I feel that GUI testing is best done by sharing it with others and letting them give feedback (how it feels, intuitive or not, etc..)

That’s because I believe that GUI is meant to enhance user experience, and should not hinder the main app functionality, so human user feedback would be best.

JUnit mainly tests functionality such as methods, so it’ll be difficult to write “useful/worth-it” tests for GUI, since for GUI it’s easier to just eyeball and test it yourself. Maybe looking at relevant apps to seeing how they did their GUI, and implementing what you find good might be more useful :p

Also interested in hearing what others think about GUI testing though!

Good morning!

I did a quick skim of the test cases you failed and I shall share some insights into what I think is causing some of the errors!

For your Phone.java, you modified the REGEX_VALIDATION to only allow 8-digit phone numbers (reasonable).
- You forgot to update the TypicalPersons.java phone numbers, with some of the Persons having 7 digit phone numbers. (See below)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6591aa21-b2c9-479a-aada-d64a949451ad)

Just to confirm I forked your branch, updated TypicalPerson.java and ran the tests. I went from failed 72 tests to 6 tests. Hope this helps despite being a little late.

I'm using Intellij on Windows. I've got this error ever since I implemented my GUI, but it didn't stop my program from running so I didn't think it was an issue. However, I would like to solve it. Here's my MainWindow.java code, the function part.
``` java
public MainWindow() ``{``
        FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"));
        fxmlLoader.setRoot(this); // Set the root
        fxmlLoader.setController(this); // Set the controller, optional if it's already set in FXML
        try ``{``
            fxmlLoader.load(); // Load the FXML file
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            e.printStackTrace();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```
And my MainWindow.fxml:
``` fxml

            maxWidth="-Infinity"

**3. :fas-info-circle: Wrote code on master branch instead of new branch. Any way to fix branching?**
</div>


Hello! I thought I switched to a new branch (branch-level-8) before starting my code, but only after finishing and running git status, I discovered that I'm still on the master branch. Is there anyway to "bring" my code over to the branch? Last time I tried to switch over to the branch and merge, I accidentally reset my progress, so I'm hoping to get a bit more clarification on this!

Also, for some reason my Sourcetree isn't syncing with my local progress, I'm not sure if I messed it up somewhere.

Here's a picture for reference, but when I commit locally on my command line, it doesn't show up on Sourcetree. 

Any clarification would be much appreciated. Thank you!

Hello! I was thinking to use enums for the commands that will be used for the chatbot, since they are constants? With these enums, I can put them in my switch-case statement instead of the plain text.

I tried something like:
'
String command = split[0].toUpperCase(); // Convert input to uppercase to match enum
Commands cmd;
                try ``{``
                    cmd = Commands.valueOf(command); // Convert to Commands enum'

Then, having a switch on cmd allows you to have different cases based on the value of command.

If I recall correctly, inheriting from an abstract class means that the `Bar` class already has the default implementation of the `process()` method, so there is no need for `Bar` to have a `process()` method in the class. Having a `process()` method there means `Bar` is overriding the implementation in `Foo`, but taking it out means it uses the default implementation from `Foo`. Hence, taking it out will not cause a compile error, as stated in option 2.

Option 4 is a ~valid~ invalid statement as you said, as how `List&lt;String> list = new ArrayList();` works.

Oh as in - the statement says that the code causes a compile error. The fact is, it does not. Hence, the statement is invalid.
`Bar` has overridden `Foo`, so `Foo foo = new Bar();` will **not** cause a compilation error.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Practice Exam p3.04 Why there is a dependency from Activity to ProgressWatcher?**
</div>

When I attempt this question, I didn't realise there is a dependency froom Activity to ProgressWatcher. Here are my (waiting-to-be-corrected) reasoning:
- watch(Watcher) depends on Watcher type of instance
- since there is an association between Activity and Watcher, no dependency is needed

Hence I am not sure why we need an explicit dependency arrow between  Activity and ProgressWatcher. Is it because ProgressWatcher is an abstract class that can be inherited?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Clarification between the typo and inconsistent command instruction**
</div>

If the command provided in the user guide is ``[n/NAME_KEYWORDS]`` ``[A/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS]``, but the meaning of ``KEYWORDS`` is not mentioned in the user guide (particularly missing in the command format section), and the error message for the command is ``[n/NAME_KEYWORD...]`` ``[a/ADDRESS_KEYWORD...]``, where the meaning of the ``...`` is clearly explained in the user guide, should this be classified as a typo? I believe that the section in the user guide may hinder the user’s understanding on the first use. However, after reading it carefully several times and trying it with the app, the behavior of the feature becomes clear to the user. Especially the examples provided in the user guide hints the behaviour of the feature. And they provided a sentence like: ``You can find students whose names, addresses, tags or lessons contain any of the given keywords.``

That being said, as a tester, I feel like it's confusing when I was testing the product before, but they did try to mention it in the user guide.

        ``}``;
        return formatters;
    ``}``
```
```Java
public static LocalDate parseDate(String input) throws InvalidDateFormatException ``{``
        LocalDate parsedDate = null;

        //get dates for next week
        Map<String, LocalDate> map = buildMap();

        if (parsedDate != null) ``{``
            return parsedDate;
        ``}``

        DateTimeFormatter[] formatters = getDateTimeFormatters();

        for (DateTimeFormatter formatter : formatters) ``{``
            try ``{``
                parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(input, formatter);
                break; // Exit loop if parsing is successful

                // Continue to the next format if parsing fails
                // hence the catch block here is leaved empty
            ``}``

            try ``{``
                parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(input + " " + LocalDate.now().getYear(), formatter);
                break;

Hi! 

I am currently trying to follow the JavaFX tutorial at [https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html](url) but when I run ./gradlew run, I keep getting an error and I can't find a solution. 

According to ChatGPT, the error says
"The error you're encountering is related to JavaFX and its native libraries not being compatible with your system architecture. Specifically, it indicates that JavaFX is trying to load native libraries (libprism_es2.dylib and libprism_sw.dylib) that are built for the x86_64 architecture, but your system requires arm64 architecture (which is typical for newer Macs with Apple Silicon)."

Based on the tutorial, we were asked to update our build.gradle using String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7' but it seems like this won't work for new Mac versions. 

Please help! Thank you!

Edit: I am getting a similar error when I try to run addressbook.jar. I think both issues need the same solution.

Yup, I am already using that version. So currently, you are running it by using the Zulu 17 version under Project Structures or did you do the second option of Add VM Options?

For the given example, it states that ActionFactory adds ActionX to a History object hence we know there History has a reference to ActionX. But why do we omit this association in the class diagram? Shouldn't we draw it as well or is this already implied by the dependency of ActionFactory to History?

Also in another example, if we put composition relationship that an email HAS-A body, why is 0 allowed? I thought composition referred to a strong ownership where if an email is created, it must have a body. Here, if email can live without body, won't it be similar to aggregation instead?

This question might be out of the syllabus scope but I just want to know more about the difference between lined arrowheads vs par frames. 

In the textbook, it is stated that lined arrowheads are used for asynchronous calls. It is also stated under the advanced section that we can use par frames to describe parallel paths. May I know if there is a difference in using lined arrowheads vs par frames? Or to put in another way, are there scenarios where one would be more suitable than another? To me, both seems to be indicating some sort of parallelism in the program.

**7. :fas-info-circle: UML Diagrams: Bidirectional vs opposite unidirectional associations**
</div>

From the textbook, it seems that two opposite two unidirectional associations between two classes does not always result in a bidirectional association. This was illustrated by the example:
```
class Person ``{``
    Cat pet;
    //...
``}``

class Cat``{``
    Person breeder;
    //...
``}``
```
I interpreted this as a class diagram like this:
<img width="344" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2a84b20-a80a-475c-9c80-c4a2b82f4b2c">

Then, another example showcasing bidirectional association was given by this example:
```
class Dog ``{``
    Man man;
    // ...
``}``

class Man ``{``
    Dog dog;
    // ...
``}``
```

So with these two examples we see that simply having a class `B` attribute in class `A` and a class `A` attribute in class `B` might not always result in bidirectional association. In the first example, we say that the breeder might not be the owner of the pet so we separate the associations. Yet, in example 2, it does not seem quite apparent to me that the "`man`" and "`dog`" are referring to the same association. The `man ` in `Dog` could refer to the owner/breeder, etc.

I am not sure if it is correct but my take on this is that the attributes should be named in a way that provides the context so that a clear association can be established. If i renamed the `breeder` to `person` in the first example, how would I know if the association is bidirectional or two separate associations?

</div>

Hi,  I noticed that the diagram shown on the website immediately creates branch-Level-8 after finishing Level-7 but I made a commit before doing Level-8. Can I check if this is alright and will not cause any interference (with the grading script, etc)?

**9. :fas-info-circle: Requirement of Java packages to match folder path**
</div>

In the textbook, it is stated that: "Furthermore, the package of a type should match the folder path of the source file.". I am a bit confused about the wording of this sentence. What exactly does "type" refer to? It has also been used throughout the section on Java packages. I am guessing that it is referring to a Java file?

Do correct me if my understanding is wrong. How I understand and interpret the statement is as follows:
If i have a Java class/file "Abc" that belongs to the package "example.myfile", "Abc.java" must be placed in the folder path "src/example/myfile/Abc.java".

If my understanding is correct, may I ask why must this be the case? What is the purpose of needing packages' names to follow the folder path of where the file is?

**5. :fas-info-circle: 💡Duke Level-1: Easily add optional indentations**
</div>

Hey guys I was looking around the web and Java documentation and found an interesting method that may be useful with adding the optional indentation.

Many would accomplish this by manually adding indentation to their string and print it out, for instance:
```java
System.out.println("    " + HORIZONTAL_LINE);
System.out.println("     Hello! I'm your friendly chat bot, how can I help you?");
```

But perhaps you have another function that produces a String with multiple lines:
```java
public static String createTwoLineString() ``{``
    // no way of adding space when printing? or is it
    return "first line\nsecond line";
``}``
```

Instead of rewriting the function to add spaces on new lines, you can use the [`String::indent(int)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#indent(int)) method which adds the specified number of spaces at the front of each line instead.
```java
System.out.println(createTwoLineString().indent(4)); // prints the string with 4 spaces infront of each line
```

If you instead wish to add a prefix of mixed characters (eg: `"\t "` - tab and a space) instead of just spaces, you can instead write a function that uses the [`String::lines()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#lines()) method which converts the `String` into a `Stream<String>` and apply Stream methods to add the prefix to the start of each line and combine into one String, or use the [`String.split("\n")`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)) method which returns an array of String of the lines of the String and use some iterative approach (I recommend using [`StringBuilder`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html)) to create a new String with the prefix appended at each line.

I think what @Incogdino has said is pretty much the gist of it. 

One point not that was brought up but not explicitly mentioned by @Incogdino is that git prefers to a do fast-forward merge (if possible) over a regular merge commit when using the `git merge branch_name` command and using the `--no-ff` flag forces git to create a merge commit; if you have two branches which both already have additional commits, `git merge` will create a merge commit as it is not possible to do a create fast-forward merge.

I think the video in the topics section ([Tools -&gt; Git and GitHub -&gt; branch: doing multiple parallel changes](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#tools-git-and-github-branch-doing-multiple-parallel-changes)) is pretty good in explaining how to do both types of merges using SourceTree. If you prefer to use the git CLI you can refer to `CLI` tab in the text sections or you can search for the multiple available videos on this topic on Youtube.

I assume you are using Windows, and it looks like your `JAVA_HOME` path variable is incorrectly set up?

First you want to go to your path variables, you can do this by searching `Edit the system environment variables` in Windows search bar which brings you to a `System Properties` window.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb919c11-1938-41a6-879f-ff98f4abc4bd)

Then click `Environment Variables` which brings you to the `Environment Variables` window.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eeb5585-73ad-485c-a8ff-b2b08a243bb9)

Then under the `System Variables` section, look in the `Variable` tab for `JAVA_HOME`.

![Screenshot 2024-08-31 145543](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee77a01-c74f-4100-a38b-24f11470b89b)

In there you should be able to change it to the Java 17 SDK probably called `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`, you can double click the row to edit it and then after changing it press `Ok`.

In addition, if you want to **rename** your tag, you first tag the commit with the new tag with `git tag ``{``new-tag``}`` ``{``commit-hash``}``` and the remove the old tag using `git tag -d ``{``old-tag``}``` and then remove your old tag from your remote repository.

To remove the old tag from your remote repository:
```sh
# remove old tag from remote repository
git push --delete origin :ref/tags/``{``old-tag``}``
```

Another way to get the font name (at least **on Windows**) without using code is by:
1. Right click on the font file (`.otf`/`.ttf`/etc) in file explorer
1. Go to `Details` tab
1. Look for the `Title` row in the `Property` column and the name should be in the `Value` column on the same row.

Alternatively, you can just open the font file (double click) and then the name should be on the top at `Font name: ``{``font name``}```.

When I try to run your jar file using `java -jar xxx.jar`, the following output is shown :
```
Error: Could not find or load main class shoai.Main
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/application/Application

I think your `gradle.build` file might not be properly configured. I also tried building your project on my local machine, but it seems that you put emoji literals into Java strings which causes Java to scream at me since this is not supported on windows.

@damithc 

I'm referring to these two issues brought up by one of our testers:
* https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/issues/245
* https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/issues/241

Our UG, just mentions that the command has the following parameters, but does not say anything about not including unrecognized parameters. Currently, depending on where you put the extra parameters you get different behaviours. The ideal behaviour would to be to reject these extra parameters or to ignore them.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c48601bc-a6af-4578-815d-9a629b7f6c52)

My team's current solution is just to add a note in our UG that users should follow the command format strictly.

In the code there are two different associations from `Mat` to `Bot`. The first is a unidirectional association `Mat ---> "helpers 0..5" Bot` and the second is a bidirectional association `Mat "partner" &lt;---> "partner" Bot`. Since the question is asking specifically about the first association, we cannot choose option B to represent that.

Note: Just because the two classes have references to each other, that they have a bidirectional association ([see textbook](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/oop.html#navigability))

The main problem i think with magical literal is poor readabilily.
So I think it is ok if the literals are self-explanatory.
Here is part of my code
```java
public String execute() ``{``
        if (taskList.size() < index || index <= 0) ``{``
            return printMessages("Sorry~ Can not delete this task as such task does not exist.");
        ``}`` else ``{``
            Task task = taskList.remove(modify(index));
            storage.updateFile(taskList);
            return printMessages(new String[]``{``"OK~. I've deleted this task:", task.toString(),
                    String.format("Now you have %s tasks in the list", taskList.size())``}``);
        ``}``
    ``}``
```
Although some strings may seem magical. But I think it is ok to leave it like that since readers are able to understand the meaning of these codes.

Your argument is reasonable. A bit more context here. Actually, the class name is called "SortCommand" and it extends from an abstract class called "Command". The execute would be to execute the command. This execute function should always do only sort the list and tell the user that the list is sorted. If I want to do other actions, I will creat a new command class. So I think it is self-explanatory.

To get the title bar do the following in your main class (the one include the build of stage and scene)

```java 
stage.setTitle("BotName");
```
This should add the bot name to the title bar.

</div>

It contains these closed collapsible boxes. Before this when i tried downloading the pdf version of the textbook i faced the same issue. 
I had to manually open these boxes and then print as pdf but since i can't modify the pdf then we are stuck with this one ig.
There is a separate section of UML in the pdf but it isn't as detailed as in the earlier reference of UML under modeling section.
I know its too late, but if it can be fixed then please do. 
Otherwise just a suggestion or a mention about this issue with the printable textbook version.

This was given in the BCD extensions page
Archiving items

Provide a way to archive items so that the user can remove items from the app but still keep a record of them somewhere e.g., archive all tasks in the list into a file so that the user can start over with a clean slate.

So it stores all the tasks and preserve their respective states. Then it removes them from the current class list.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Default Visibility in Java**
</div>

Practice Paper Question:
<img width="973" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8f736b1-e8a1-42ba-b4f6-6d0215d27ea0">
Answer given:
<img width="909" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6a211b6-e4fd-48c1-8131-6a65576df131">

Based on the given answer, I understand that the default visibility of a class method is `package-protected`. Therefore, in the `Activity` class diagram, the method visibilities are shown as `~`. However, for interfaces, I understand that methods are automatically declared as `public abstract`.

This leads me to question whether it is necessary to explicitly mark methods in an interface as abstract (e.g., by using ```{````}``` or _italics_), or if doing so is unnecessary. Does the label of interface `<<interface>>` implicitly mark all its methods to be abstract?

Adding on, I note that the overridden method `update(int)` in `UIWidget` is marked as public even though it's actual method signature is not shown, can I assume that for a class that implements an interface, the overridden methods will always be public? 

Appreciate any clarification on this matter.

**3. :fas-info-circle: Issues with PDF Header and Duplicate Heading in User Guide**
</div>

I have encountered a couple of issues while working on our User Guide that I need some help resolving:

1. PDF Header Displays Incorrect Name
When attempting to print the user guide as a PDF, the header still shows "UniNet," which is our previous product name, instead of "AdmiNUS." We have already updated the title in the config.yml file to "AdmiNUS", and updated it to Prof Damith, but the change doesn’t seem to be reflected in the PDF output. Could you provide some guidance on what might be causing this discrepancy and how I can correct it?

2. Duplicate Heading on the Website
I am also facing an issue with duplicate headings appearing on the AdmiNUS website. In the markdown file, I have only defined a single instance of the heading, but it appears twice on the generated webpage. When I tried removing the heading from the markdown file, both instances of the heading disappeared from the website. I have attached screenshots to illustrate this issue:

@cth06-Github I note that you say there won't be an interface object in the object diagram as it's impossible to have an interface object. However, we are allowed to use the interface type as the reference type of an object right? For example, if class A implements interface B, and we have an object of type A, it's valid to do `a:B` even though B is an interface. Am I correct?

1. For the first question, I agree with you that the `owner` and `task` should be removed, as you explained. The association class already shows the relationship between `Person` and `Task`. However, I believe the diagram could be made clearer by labeling `allocated to` from `Task` to `Person` or the roles `owner` and `task`, as demonstrated in the example from the textbook below:

<img width="626" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47fee91a-a662-4c62-bf68-7635fd85589a">

2. Good question. I’m also wondering whether we should strictly follow the instructions provided (the inheritance of `ProjectManager` and `StaffManager` is not explicitly specified) or rely on common sense based on how it works in the real world.

IMO it is appropriate to commit changes made for the same purpose e.g. multiple new files created to implement a new function, together; On the other hand it would be beneficial to commit changes made in the same file but for different purposes separately, so it's easy to identify where problem may come from when issues arise.

I have encountered the same issue. In my case it was caused by white space before escape sequences which is included in the string even at the end of a string.

For example
```
System.out.println("something \n" + "else \n");
```
Prints one extra white space at the end of each line.

Hope this may help.

My solution is to simply omit unnecessary white spaces in my string eg.

Instead of 

```
System.out.println("stuff \n"+"more stuff \n";

I posted an issue yesterday mentioning one probable cause of this problem(and I'm getting tagged for this issue what an amazing algorithm behind this), that if your entry point extends Application you might run into this error. The solution is to have a separate entry class that doesn't extend Application. This was mentioned in AB3 as pointed by someone else so I closed the issue. Hope it helps.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Does 2103T account for the exam issues reported as additional credit?**
</div>

Asking this because in general this mod seems to give additional credit for inconsistencies in notes etc. 

Some of the concerns I have regarding the paper (eg. the box indexing in the sequence diagram in part 1) are the same concerns that a lot of my friends have. I am assuming the teaching staff will be getting a lot of emails regarding the same thing. Hence I wanted to clarify this quesiton before writing an email.

**3. :fas-info-circle: Can we use an open source external JavaFX component in our TP**
</div>

Hello,

My team is currently developing an app for small-scale private tutors to manage students and lessons. We’re considering integrating a calendar feature and are exploring the use of the open-source JavaFX component, CalendarFX.

May we clarify if we’re allowed to use CalendarFX for our project? Additionally, if we are permitted to use it, would relying on an external library like this raise any concerns regarding code quality or adherence to coding conventions in the context of CS2103T? Since the component’s source code won’t be written by us, we want to ensure we won’t face any issues.

Thanks in advance!

**7. :fas-info-circle: Issue with List<String> in IntelliJ IDEA**
</div>

### Issue with `List<String>` in IntelliJ IDEA

**Environment:**
- IntelliJ IDEA version: 23
- Java version: 17

**Problem:**

I'm encountering an issue in IntelliJ IDEA where it red-underlines `List<String>` and prompts me to use the raw type `List` instead. The code snippet where this occurs is:

```java
List<String> strings = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/rapgod.txt"));  //error prompted
```

To resolve this, the only thing that works is using the fully qualified class name:

```java
java.util.List<String> strings = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/rapgod.txt"));
```

I already have the following import statement in my code:

```java
import java.util.List;
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect IntelliJ to recognize the `List<String>` type without needing to use the fully qualified class name, given that the import statement is already in place.

**Steps Taken:**

- Verified the import statement is correct.
- Restarted IntelliJ.

**Request:**

Could someone help me understand why this issue is occurring and how to resolve it? TIA!

Hello everyone, I appreciate all the detailed and quick replies. 

When I was going back to take a screenshot to attatch to this issue, I realised the problem. I had created my own 'List.java' to abstract the task list in the chatbot without realising that the name clashes with java's List.java (my bad)

I will change the class name to TaskList

So sorry about this careless mistake. Thanks again everyone!

## My applications of ChatGPT

### 1. Markdown File Generation 
I've used GPT to create README files, AI acknowledgements, or other documentation. This has saved me time and made my documentation look neater.

### 2. Javadoc Skeletons
I used GPT to create javadoc comment skeletons that include necessary annotations like `@link` and other decorators to create cross-references within the code (that I did not know about actually). After generating the initial structure, I can then go back and change some details if needed,

### 3. Generating Repetitive Code
I also used GPT to generate repetitive code, like class constructors that involve multiple fields or long snums.

I agree with @KrashKart that both violate LoD
Although the notes say:
> More concretely, a method m of an object O should invoke only the methods of the following kinds of objects: 
> 
> - The object O itself
> - Objects passed as parameters of m
> - Objects created/instantiated in m (directly or indirectly)
> - Objects from the direct association of O

I believe it implies that

I could be wrong though

I think taskList is most descriptive, and tasks follows the plural convention as it stores multiple tasks. Personally I would follow taskList as it gives clear indication of what it is.

Our current version is here https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp
and we use LocalDate and DateTimeFormatter. This is the relevant part of the error message:

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Dates should be in the format dd MMM yyyy (e.g. 24 Sep 2024) at hallpointer.address.commons.util.AppUtil.checkArgument(AppUtil.java:39)

Does anyone have gradle files that pass on Mac (ARM), so we could check whether that is the issue, or if it is some kind of system time zone/date setting at work? Thanks.

I assume that
1) A class needs a javadoc at the top (above the class name and below import / package, no blank lines in between) with a brief statement of what its for and nothing else
2) Constructor, and everything but getters/setters and overrided methods inherited from above needs one (at the top, no blank lines in beteen); you can autogenerate those using the relevant guide. The top sentence needs to be a brief summary of what it does, a blank line, and then the rest of the @ notations.

Is that correct? Couldn't quite find examples or a very clear example of requirements anywhere, thanks.

I'm not part of this team, but since this is a related scenario:

What about if the help window could've had a close button added to close or minimise without requiring mouse input and only by keyboard pressed,

something relatively trivial to implement (just need to use Scenebuilder to duplicate a button, then write an event handler)?

For pushing changes from the local branch to the corresponding remote branch, the website used this command

But, when I tried using this command while being in the add-intro branch, it worked as well

`$ git push`

If you do the second way while being in the branch whose changes you want to push, does it by default push to the origin and that's why we don't have to specify which remote repo we are pushing it to? So unless we have other remote repos we want to push to, can we just use the shortcut of git push? Is it also the same for git pull as well?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question about Planned Enhancements**
</div>

Hi Profs, 

Was just wondering if the `Planned Enhancements` Section involves an enhancement that requires a **major rework** of the design (e.g. new association between major model classes that were previously not associated), would it still be immune to bugs reported about it? Like this association (in my opinion) should have been there from the beginning, but my bug report just points out a flaw that arises as a result of this lack of association, rather than the design itself.

This rework is not addressed in the `Planned Enhancements`, but only the outcome, user-end feature is included in the enhancement.

Can the unexpected handling of inputs written in languages that do not use the english alphapet be considered as not in scope?

>Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.
I didn't copy and paste and instead it just auto-filled it, so I'm unsure why it still didn't record. 

@damithc I see, but I am still unsure as to why it didn't record in the dashboard since the updated Readme shows on my iP too, despite my commits. Becayse I seem to be meeting all the requirements listed (unless it has something to do with the emoji format). Could it perhaps be something to do with the progress tracker?😕

Hello everyone, I was reviewing the notes on coupling, and noticed that **option f** indicates coupling. Doesn't having to "follow the same data format or communication protocol" imply that they might both be coupled to some other component (the data format or communication protocol), rather than to each other? Thanks for any help!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Looking for helpful classmates to test .jar file!**
</div>

Hi all,

I'm looking for anyone who is keen to help me test my .jar file, particular on a Windows machine! Steps are as listed below:

1. Download the `casper.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/yizhong187/ip/releases/download/A-Release/casper.jar).
2. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .jar file.
3.  Run the application using the following command:
```bash
java -jar casper.jar
```
4. A command prompt will open, allowing you to enter commands such as list, sort, find, and more.
Here are some example commands you can try:
`list`: Lists all tasks.
`todo buy milk`: Adds a new todo task with the description “buy milk”.
`mark 1`: Marks the first task as complete.

Feel free to refer to my [user guide](https://yizhong187.github.io/ip/) for all features and leave a comment below to let me know if it works well or not!

Thank you!

```
public Duke(String filePath) ``{``
     ui = new Ui();
     storage = new Storage(filePath);

 ``}``
```

When attempting the MoreOOP Increment, I notice this example, where a new Ui object is instantiated, and the `showLoadingError` method was called from that object. However, assuming the `showLoadingError` method does not require any instance variable from the object, is it acceptable to set it as a static method that can be used without the instantiation of an object?

Consequently, is it okay for me to have a PrintUtils class in a utils package that contains only static methods that are used for outputting message to the user?

@Incogdino `showLoadingError` would not display a custom error depending on the type of exception thrown, and is stateless (I assume, based on the fact that nothing was passed/done to the Ui object). However, it is made an instance method, instead of a static one, and that is breaking my expectation of:

> If the behavior of the method is predictable with or without an instance of the class, then a static method is more suitable.

@Incogdino LOL (can I say that in the forum 🤣 ) I think we understand each other, I am just pointing out the fact that `showLoadingError` does not correspond with **our common understanding**  that stateless methods should be declared as static. Anyways thanks for your help and discussion :)

I've fixed the issue! The problem lies in some of my storage function adding extra lines into the local file, pushing some of the entries down some lines and hence going out of range.

Unfortunate, on MacOS, it's not possible to run the .jar file by just click on it :(

If I don't want to add any functionality and only changes in function files will be made, should I still update the jar file. Basically I realised that I had commented out my entire test file in the jar (I was fixing some tests but forgot to uncomment out the tests - I didn't know about disable tests at that time 😅). Today morning I was just looking at the code when I realised I basically don't have tests. So for getting the marks of testing section of ip I need to update just the tests. Is it possible to still get marks for that.
Thanks for answering so promptly

**1. :fas-info-circle: Completed `A-Assertions` and `A-CodeQuality` with wrong branch name**
</div>

I've completed the features `A-Assertions` and `A-CodeQuality`, but unfortunately I have labelled their branches `A-Assertions` and `A-CodeQuality` instead of the required `branch-A-Assertions` and `branch-A-CodeQuality`. As such they correctly show up as red in my progress tracker.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97b11b9f-c89d-443d-83d2-e83ee3e82843)

Is there a recommended way to fix this issue? Should I unmerge the branches, rename, then merge them back?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Variable scope in `switch`**
</div>

I've noticed that variables declared in the `case` block of a `switch` share the same scope.

For example,

```Java
switch (command) ``{``

case MarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new MarkCommand(taskList, id);

case UnmarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new UnmarkCommand(taskList, id);

``}``
```

if you try to compile and run this, there will be an error `Duplicate local variable id`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4c37b7-c99a-4784-971e-0a51a6178450)

Currently, my workaround this issue is to introduce a closure by adding ```{````}``` around the `case` block, like in the code snippet below. This is quite readable in my opinion as it does not really disrupt the original flow of code. I believe it is also compliant with checkstyle since `./gradlew checkstyleMain` does not give me any errors.

```Java
switch (command) ``{``

case MarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD: ``{``
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new MarkCommand(taskList, id);
``}``

case UnmarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD: ``{``
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new UnmarkCommand(taskList, id);
``}``

``}``
```

Are there other ways to handle this issue? Is this method reasonable?

The reason for the missing components was mentioned in [AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/blob/4eb130f32ef1a3b492ce25c741fb06defd26fad4/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java#L8-L23):

```java
/**
 * The main entry point to the application.
 *
 * This is a workaround for the following error when MainApp is made the
 * entry point of the application:
 *
 *     Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
 *
 * The reason is that MainApp extends Application. In that case, the
 * LauncherHelper will check for the javafx.graphics module to be present
 * as a named module. We don't use JavaFX via the module system so it can't
 * find the javafx.graphics module, and so the launch is aborted.
 *
 * By having a separate main class (Main) that doesn't extend Application
 * to be the entry point of the application, we avoid this issue.
 */

Why doesn't ProgressWatcher have a update(int) under it (eg like option c). Is it because even though ProgressWatcher implements Watcher, it doesn't override the update method so it is redundant to add the method under it? If this is true, then is it safe to say that we only include the method for subclasses if they override that method, otherwise it is redundant to add such methods under the subclasses.

I was wondering whether a branch node can act as a merge node and vice versa. Since after the branch node ([less than 3 tries]), the next node it encounters is actually a branch node ([all positive]/[else]). Or does the  [less than 3 times] path ends at the `user places hand on reader` action (just that the merge node wasn't shown) ?

Given that our UG specified the correct behavior and an existing correct implementation exists, can we implement a fix where Student uses the method's implementation within Teacher?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on whether fixing Sort Command would violate feature freeze.**

Currently, our Sort Command has the following bug. Say you decide to sort many people by name, it will initially do the sort. However, if you then change some non-name field of a person, the order of the list will change.

Is this a bug we are allowed to fix? Thank you.

So the website states the minimal requirement for Level 8, is to use a LocalDate(or LocalDateTime) object for deadline objects.

I decided to use LocalDate objects for events, but I wanted to ask, was it implied that LocalDateTime is more suitable / required for Event objects? 

i.e 
is `event team meeting /from 10-10-2024 /to 10-10-2024` sufficient?
or would `event team meeting /from 10-10-2024 1800 /to 10-10-2024 1900` be required to hit the minimal requirement?

Hi @marchjlim 

This problem could be related to how IntelliJ is handling the project configuration as opposed to the code. 

1. Try `./gradlew clean build run`. And additionally try restarting your IDE for good measure. 
2. Try resetting Intellij's cache: **File** -&gt; **Invalidate Caches / Restart**
3. Go to your settings, go to **Build, Execution, and Deployment** -&gt; **Build tools** -&gt; **Gradle** and make sure that the build and run, and run tests are set to Gradle, and have not accidentally changed when you changed your commit. 

Another thing, when you say, 'run it on intellij', can I just confirm that you are using one of the methods mentioned [here?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6G3RyxEMk#t=13m44s) (i.e using the gradle window). 
Because if you are using the standard green run button, you might need to edit your Run configurations, by going to the drop down menu besides the run button, clicking **Edit configurations ... **, and look for the run configuration for the Main class. Click on it, and make sure that it points to the correct class. 

EDIT: Just a small note for point 3, in the same **Build tools** window, also just check that your Gradle JVM is set to the same version that you are using in terminal. (I got this tip from Issue #189, as recommended by @damithc in the subsequent comment)

You could check out this similar issue: #185 

Could I ask for some more details regarding this?

1. Firstly, did you submit everything on time? If so, this is likely a bug, but can you send a screenshot of your source tree branch merge details. This is to make sure you have merged everything correctly. 
2. Secondly, are you sure you pushed your local branches to the remote repository. If you didn't, you may have just pushed the tag and commit, and thus it won't identify your branches.

Hi @jian7490, would you be able to copy the code and put it in a code block next time?

There definitely is a recurring error message saying : "have x86_64, need arm...", but before looking into those, do try the following:

1. Do the following command: `java -version` and make sure you have the correct java version as referenced by this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html). You need to have this exact version, and as they say in the guide, 

> This version is resilient to compatibility issues between Mac ARM and Mac Intel computers when creating/running Java GUI applications built using JavaFX.

Do let me know whether this works, and if it doesn't, there are a few other possible fixes we can look into.

Hi @michaelyql 

So if I'm not wrong, the logger you're referring to is a variable, and the Singleton design pattern typically refers to a class which is set up in such a way that there can only be one instance, i.e the class will have a private constructor, a private static theOne variable, and a getInstance method that gets that Singleton instance for you.

By any chance, were you trying to ask whether the LogsCenter class is a singleton? If so, I think actually, the LogsCenter class is not a Singleton, as firstly, it's `init()` method(which acts as its constructor) is a public method. Secondly, there is no instance in the LogsCenter class which holds the Singleton, i.e a `theOne` variable.  

Hope that helps!

There was actually a similar question in the week 8 part 1 quiz. Firstly, just to clarify it's not an association because Activity is not holding any objects or references to ProgressWatcher so it can't be a straight line. Secondly, Activity still depends on the variable Progresswatcher.MAX and so cannot compile without ProgressWatcher.

My initial thoughts was similar to what @cth06-Github had mentioned, to use Enums for commands however, it seemed unnecessary and makes the code more convoluted (at least in my opinion). Hence, I was wondering if the fact that I had difficulty seeing how Enums can be incorporated is due to bad code design on my part.

Hi, you may refer to issue  #21. I think it is not necessary to move the tag.

However, if you do wish to do so, you may do
``` 
git tag -d [tag]
git tag [tag]
```

you will need to delete the original tag since it is not permitted to have the same tag on multiple commits.

**7 :fas-comment:**
</div>

@Incogdino I think that is a valid concern. However, considering that a program crashing due to Exceptions is not supposed to be a frequent occurrence, the only other reason I can think of right now where a program terminates without `"bye"` is when the user close the terminal (similar to clicking "X" on a window when the app has a GUI). 

Not sure if there is a better way to save the data, but I am current storing it in a `.txt` file with `','` delimiter. 
ie.
```
T,0,borrow book
D,1,return book,Sunday
E,0,project meeting,Mon 2pm,4pm
...
```

suppose the task list were to get large, and I were to update the file for the 30th item out of 100, there is no way (I don't think so?) to selectively change that particular line other than rewriting all the other tasks again. That would mean not just the writing to file but also looping through `n items` in my `ArrayList` and appending them to string (at least for my implementation).

If we have to account for the unexpected termination of program, I think a `save` command feature might be a way to mitigate such situations, though not a direct solution as it does not solve the issue of "unexpected".

without code snippets it is hard to pinpoint the problem, but a possible reason might be the relative path. one way to start debugging is to specify a different path for your test storage. for example, my Storage uses ./data/tasks.txt but for StorageTest, it uses ./tmp/tasks.txt and then observe where the folders are initialised

Even though score of the team is discrete and finite, we may want to perform arithmetic operations on it, such as adding a score when the team wins a game or subtracting the score when the team receives a penalty, which is not supported by the enum type, (and just to add on, enum types are usually used for comparison, switch statements and other non-arithmetic operations) hence representing the team score using enum type variable is not appropriate.

If you highlight the code there, it is using spaces. Go to Canvas and try for yourself

I completely understand that its not the **'\t'** char but **' '** char that is the standard, that which I agree with. Would like to highlight that it is possible by configuration of your IDE / editor, that the tab key's output can be changed to 4-spaces, hence easily misunderstood to be equivalent.

> It's not Slapping hard and it's accessing field members is a big nono, especially if FullName might change or depend on object state.

I dont think not "SLAP"ping hard is the biggest issue, it is also not relevant in answering whether it violates LOD. Also as prof mentioned, how are you evaluating for SLAP? These are all single line return statements for the methods, unless you're referring to the examples themselves which without the body of the code, there is nothing to reference to evaluating SLAP. 

In answering Norbert's question, one tip to see if you violate LOD is to ask, (as a XXX object) am I accessing my own attributes or am I attempting to access other's attributes or methods?

Let's break down example 1 (example 2 is the same concept of example 1 except the client is doing less work)
> `lessonExample.getPerson().getName().fullname`

- lessonExample.getPerson() // returns a Person object, the object is an attribute stored within the Lesson object (lessonExample)
- .getName() // returns a Name object, thats within the Person object, at this point not violating LOD, depends on what you do after
- .fullname // accessing the attribute of the Name object (exposing information which shouldn't happen), violates LOD

I want to point out that in example 2 -- put yourself in the shoes of a Lesson object and now you're the client interacting with a Person object. In this case you're asking for the attributes from the Person object (and subsequently tearing information out), instead of telling the Person object to provide the information you need.

As Yadobler mentioned, the Person class should have a method that provides what you need (fullname), instead of allowing other classes to reach into the Name attribute and take the information.

How does this look like?

```
class Lesson ``{``
    Person person;
    // constructor and other methods
    String getPersonName() ``{``
        return this.person.getFullName();
    ``}``
``}``
```

```
class Person ``{``
    Name name;
    // other methods
    String getFullName() ``{``
        return this.name.getFullName();
    ``}``
``}``
```

```
class Name ``{``
    String fullname;
    // other methods
    String getFullName() ``{``
        return this.fullname;
    ``}``
``}``
```

In a closing note, the tell-dont-ask principle goes hand-in-hand with LOD, and as much as possible, you should redirect tasks to your attributes instead of plucking information out and doing it yourself.

> However, if we throw an error in these cases, would that be seen as violating the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?

I dont fully understand your questions.
Let me interpret your question. Assume this is your code
```
class Person ``{``
    ... //attributes
    public String editHours(int hoursForVolunteers) ``{`` // can be renamed to just "edit"
        return "Error: this person has no hours to edit";
    ``}``
    
    public String editDonationAmount(double amount) ``{`` // can be renamed to just "edit" also
        return "Error: this person has no amount to edit";
    ``}``
``}``
```

```
class Volunteer extends Person ``{``
    private int hours;
    
    public String editHours(int hours) ``{``
        // do stuff
        return "success";
     ``}``
``}``
```

```
class Donors extends Person ``{``
    private double amount;
    
    public String editDonationAmount(double amount) ``{``
        // do stuff
        return "success";
     ``}``
``}``
```

> LSP: Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the program.

For this there is application of substitutability. You could substitute `Person p = new Volunteer()` and do `p.editHours(1)`. The code is just not applying polymorphism, ie you need to know the subtype and apply the method. In terms of whether throwing errors, I presume you dont mean exceptions hence the String messages only. It will look a bit complicated if the methods throw errors, but nonetheless it isn't violating substitutability

Now if your code looks like

```
class Person ``{``
    public String edit(int i) throws Exception ``{``
        throw new Exception();
    ``}``
    // edit(double d)
``}``
```

```
class Volunteer extends Person ``{``
    public String edit(int i) throws Exception ``{``
        // do stuff and do not throw exception
    ``}``
``}``
```

This also does not violate LSP. But in the above example, polymorphism can be applied.

On your 2nd question:
> would enforcing role-specific validation (i.e., throwing an error when users attempt to edit a field not applicable to the instance) violate LSP?

I do not understand how your implementation is so I cant advise you. But if you see the 2nd example I gave, it is not necessary for validating (or type-checking / type-verifying) the types. I would think that, if the typechecking methods are in the subtypes but not supertype then yes it would violate LSP (eg. `boolean isVolunteer()` only appearing in Volunteer and not Person)

Hope my understanding of your question helps to answer

@damithc Could you share what is the frequency of the job? Would there be any additional considerations to running the job more frequently?

Edit: I read some the [reposense](https://reposense.org/index.html) documentation, seems like this is a program looks at all the public forks to generate a report and the dashboard repo triggers a job that runs this report generator and deploys it to the webpage. Is there rate limiting going on that prevents more frequent deploys?

>I think it is quite inefficient to write to file for every change as I/O operations are slow

Unless got few hundred concurrent requests, what are the chances it will actually be inefficient currently? File I/O is already quite efficient (see SQLite).

The value of logging correct atomic transactions seem to outweigh efficiency in this case not only because basically few people are using it, but also the task list is performing the function of book keeping, which is essentially an extremely basic database.

IMO, if you are at the point where speed of I/O operations matter, you can consider offloading that responsibility to a DB solution.

Personally, I just did the minimum to satisfy the requirement.

Edit: Thinking about your question, perhaps a better question to ask is how can i design the code such that I can provide an interface for my code to talk to, such that I don't care about the I/O implementation (algorithm implementation). For that, you can consider some design patterns like Adapter pattern or strategy pattern. But whether or not it is worth the effort to write that into code for a simpler problem like this, is debatable. It depends on your personal objectives.

This should be correct. What's the point of testing implementation? A significant point of writing tests is to ensure that when code changes, behaviour doesn't. Testing the contract makes more sense.

Regardless of what you did, the git SHAs will still persist in the git DB for a period of time before the git GC removes it permanently.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Working on the same feature in a pair**
</div>

I am working with one of my teammates for one of the features our team has decided to add to AB3 this week.

We're slightly unsure about how to go about the tp workflow in this context.

My initial thought was to a create a branch called 'add-said-feature', commit a small bit of code that doesn't break the 
team repo, and create a PR. There would then hopefully be a way for my teammate to track this branch and make his changes to it and update the same PR. Then we could simultaneously communicate to incrementaly integrate the feature bit by bit. Is there a way to do this? Is this even aligning with the required workflow for the tp right now?

Another thought was to create branches for these bits and pieces of each feature. For instance, I would create a branch called 'add-said-feature-step1', commit and get it merged. Then my teammate would push the branch 'add-said-feature-step2' and get it merged, and so on. All these branches would have to make sure they don't break the code in the main repo.

I think I have corrected the code, by then pulling the changes into the second branch and then merging the branch back to master using the regular merge method (without PR creation). Hence the git graph looks different to the instruction page. Is this okay? By okay I want to verify two things:

IntelliJ often recommends this 'enhanced switch' when using switch-case - would using it breach of coding style in the course?

In any case, I'd recommend switching to ArrayList for what I think this part of your code is trying to do.

I used AI tools to complete tasks I consider menial because it is quite clear to me how it should be done and what standards should be maintained. Such tasks include writing Javadoc comments or assisting with considering edge cases for testing the to-do list application using Junit in the IP. It saves time, but also enables us to replicate real world programming in the modern day. In my experience so far, even full time SWEs use AI to complete similar tasks, so it makes sense to take advantage of the opportunity to train this practice in a SWE course.

From my understanding, I missed step 3.4 in the instructions. After merging master (with changes pulled from the first PR) into my second branch, I did not push the updated branch to the remote. Is this correct? Or did I miss something else?

This is so that we stay as close as possible to the full lockdown mode.

Hi Prof @damithc , if this is the outcome, I think there may be another problem.

I'm on a Mac (Using the Preview app), and I think the Ctrl/Cmd F does not work for the contents of the Exam-reference.pdf downloaded from Canvas. For example, doing a CMD F on the word 'Navigability' will only find the word in the UML reference sheet and the Appendix at the very bottom of the document. However, the word is there in the main body of the notes and not detected.

Seems like the search works for the UML reference sheet and the Java Coding Standard pages, but words in the main body of the notes are not detected.

For some reason, the run for ubuntu-latest is taking forever. It might be because previously I pushed a change (added 2 new lines of dependencies to build.gradle file) and it caused this particular workflow to take forever to run. However, i've removed the dependencies and it's back to the original build.gradle file because i realised that i don't need the new dependencies that were added (deleted the 2 lines and pushed it but it's still taking forever to run) .It's not failing, just taking forever to run... If I can't pass these runs, i won't be able to merge the PR.

Hi since assert statements are meant for testing important assumptions that should already hold (potential errors should already be handled such that the assumptions should hold) should we catch it if it's actually thrown. Or should our program function 100% correctly such that at all times it shouldn't be thrown at all because all assumptions should already hold, and that assert statements are simply just there for the last protective measure ?

With regards to the text-Ui-testing, since we're required to do level-7 which is to save the tasks into a script, then what's the use of running the runtest.bat and checking if ACTUAL.TXT == EXPECTED.TXT.  Since, EXPECTED.TXT will always change as we add more tasks to the list and the script .txt file will always get updated with more new tasks, then we will always have to manually change the EXPECTED.TXT each time, because the output system.out will always change.

or are assert statements mainly to serve as a form of documentation that clearly states the assumptions or constraints of the code at a specific point for easier debugging in future maybe, or for others to understand ur code better.
Since if perhaps errors/exceptions are potentially alr accounted for/handled, what's the use of assert statements

The test finishes immediately because I commented out PersonCardTest.java which was the issue. However, the reason why I wrote this file was so that I can test the PersonCard.java - it is causing my codecov to fail at 33.33%. I've made several changes to the PersonCard.java and am attempting to write tests for that file to increase code coverage. At least the problem as to why the workflow took forever to run has surfaced. Thanks! I suspect it might be because I forgot to close the temporary application in the tests. Will look into it!

I think this is referring to the requirement for the subject of the latest 5 commits of your ip to follow the standard given in the textbook, which are 1) Use imperative mood, 2) Capitalise first letter, 3) Don't end subject line with a period. If your recent commits don't follow these guidelines, maybe you could add minor edits and commit them with appropriate commit messages. I also don't think you need the full commit messages for this git standard label to turn green.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on updating the UI**
</div>

In our PE-D, my team received a bug in which if someone executes the `find` command and executes another command (one of those newly added commands) following the find command, the UI is not refreshed and displays the same person returned by the `find` command. Although this gets resolved when the user executes the `list` command, there is an inconsistency in our application since it works perfectly for some commands. The reason for this is due to the fact that the model was not updated upon executing those few commands. This deviates from our advertised behavior.
So would fixing this be considered a violation of the feature freeze?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Sequential vs iterative approach**

<img width="472" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5f0b022-872f-4fda-a2f8-bd951aab7f9a">

What is the reason the circled option is true (ie. we should use iterative approach)? If I were to just base it off the advice given in the course textbook (picture below) about when to use the sequential model, it would seem that, since Facebook already exists and is a "well-understood problem", I should be going with that. I can think of some reasons why it would make sense (eg. project of cloning Facebook might be too big, so sequential might be too high of a risk), but wouldn't that go against the _main(?)_ guideline given?

I have an NRIC field, but my application does not accept NRICs starting with "M" (Only for foreigners).

Is this still considered a feature flaw? where I am rejecting a "valid" NRIC (even though it will never happen in the context of my app)

> Hi since assert statements are meant for testing important assumptions that should already hold (potential errors should already be handled such that the assumptions should hold) should we catch it if it's actually thrown. 

I don't think assertions should be "caught". You want to find out whether or not assertions are actually true asap, you don't want to try stopping the assertions from telling you something is wrong with your code.

From the course website:

> This is because an assertion failure indicates a possible bug and the sooner the execution stops, the safer it is.

> Since if perhaps errors/exceptions are potentially alr accounted for/handled, what's the use of assert statements

Raising errors/exceptions and assertions deal with different things.

From the course website:

> The raising of an exception indicates an unusual condition created by the user (e.g. user inputs an unacceptable input) or the environment (e.g., a file needed for the program is missing).
An assertion failure indicates the programmer made a mistake in the code (e.g., a null value is returned from a method that is not supposed to return null under any circumstances).

Just to clarify, are we allowed to add new commands under the `Planned Enhancements` section (e.g. Given that I currently only have a command to add a field, can I add an enhancement for adding a delete command for that field)?

Okay thank you, so is it the case where

Yup I agree that the path coverage option is the best answer, but what if the iterative approach option was a standalone question, would it be correct and incorrect?

Also, I do agree that it makes sense to do it iteratively, but I think my main concern has to do with whether or not to follow the guideline I mentioned, given that, that is the only explicit guideline given in the textbook (I think? correct me if I'm wrong), to decide sequential vs iterative.

Hi all, any idea why my code can be run via

java -jar "/Users/celeschai/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Current Modules/CS2103T/ip/build/libs/bee.jar"
```
but not via double click of the `.jar` file...

you can check out my version 2.0 release for the mentioned files!
the error that is shown in the terminal is:

**5. :fas-info-circle: Git branching**
</div>

Hi all would appreciate any confirmation on my understanding on why things went wrong and suggestions on how I may attempt to fix this predicament.

I branched out to branch-level-7 at commit A.
But I realised I was still working on branch master, and I committed my changes - commit B on master.

Then I checkout to branch-level-7 and fetch the code from commit B on master, made further changes and commit C on branch-level-7. 

I merged back to master after commit C, I think it is because there is only one extra commit, git automatically did a ff merge for me so now branch-level-7 is technically the same as my master branch (same commits with same hashes, looks linear in GUI). Not sure if this understanding of the problem is accurate.

Hi @damithc just to double confirm, for the command that we are supposed to put under each feature, are we expected to come up with something entirely new? Or we can reuse the commands from the original ab3? Say for example the add contact feature.

@SherChew27 i faced the same issue as you.

For our app, there is an issue where if an invalid index for a person is used e.g. greater than list size, it will just state contact was not found, instead of invalid index. The FAQ for error messages mentioned in the feature freeze that it is not allowed to change the error message to a more detailed one, but in this case the error message is not entirely accurate.

Would it violate the feature freeze to change the error message to the correct one?

IntelliJ has local history, right click on file, select local history as shown from option menu, click on show history and revert to your change. Note this is different from git and is IntelliJ's autosave feature. This saves all changes even uncommitted ones and shows all the way back to class creation. If you did not use the IDE to code, look for stashed changes and please start using the IDE in the future.

By default, Local History is configured to store revisions for the last 5 working days (that is, days when the file was modified). In the Settings dialog ( Ctrl Alt 0S ) , go to Advanced Settings. In the IDE section, provide the desired retention period value in the Duration of storing changes in Local History field.

The page broke when me migrated to markbind from jekyll, a few weeks ago.
During the markbind commit, I only copied over the changes from switch-to-markbind, we couldn't merge because we had edited the docs

For github pages settings I have tried 

* Deploy from actions
* Deploy from master/root
* Deploy from master/docs

None of them work

Thank you prof it works now, 
the problem was not with the root, the problem was with the branch, I was deploying from master branch, as I presumed gh pages was the name of the working branch for the tutorial/guide (like the switch-to-markbind branch), before being merged into the master branch, 

As Jekyll and all other github pages deployments run from master branch/docs; I believed that would be the corresponding setting in our repo as well.

Turns out gh-pages is a separate branch maintained by the Github Actions, not us; so for Markbind that needs to be active irrespective of other tp settings.

Thank you once again for your help.

hello I have tested your ip, to me only 2 commands came in trouble, which are the "load" and "archive" commands in need  of more instruction, as a user at first I didn't realize that I have to open the folder and check the file name. I was quite lost and wondering what do you mean by "archive file name with extension", at the time when I was trying to use this command. Probably give my function on archive command so that user can choose their own filename instead of checking them by themselves. Or add some new command to check what archives do they have right now.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on whether displayed parameters not matching with UG count as bugs**
</div>

Within the UG, the advertised parameter list was:  
`add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [s/SKILL]...`  

Within the app, the displayed parameter list was:  
`add n/NAME p/PHONE [s/SKILLS]...`

Are we allowed to change the message displayed, since from FAQ Q6, the current message is incorrect?  
Also, if we inputted a invalid skill, the error message would be that `Tag only accepts alphanumeric`, can we change `Tag` to `Skill` since this is an outdated AB3 terms?

Seeking clarification because these changes could also be argued using `the current behavior is not strictly 'incorrect' but 'can be better'`.

There is a similar discussion linked [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/208). 

For the IP, I also believe that there is no point to defining a static variable for the task type, especially when it is used in 2 isolated methods and nowhere else. Perhaps within the javadocs remark that D is the short-form for Deadline so that people who are not familiar with this IP can understand what it means. 

On the flip-side, suppose that you want to change the format from "D" to "Deadline", you have to replace these 2 instances of the magic literal, which is doable. However, if we scale up the project more and have multiple instances of the task type utilized across the code-base, having a constant declared lets you change all these instances from one place.

The code snippet does not show the `ProgressWatcher` class having a concrete implementation for the `update` method and since it is an abstract class this is allowed and only classes which extends the abstract class need to provide a concrete implementation.

</div>

If there is an issue with the use case (a step is mentioning internal details of system) and this was repeated for many of the use cases, would the severity increase due to the number of times it was repeated? If it was just one use case, I would put it as severity low but it is in most of the use cases. Does this mean severity medium is more appropriate?

A tester reported a bug for our product, because of the help command that has a chance to cause the addressBook to hang if the help window is opened while the addressBook is opened in fullScreen. However, based on testing on a MacBook it seems to affect all AB3 addressBooks.

It also seems to be a problem from previous semester: https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/pe-dev-response/issues/1126

Furthermore, this problem is impossible to test for if a person does not use a MacBook. We are also unsure if this is a problem with the AB3 or a problem with the MacBook OS and thus, are unsure of how to handle this.

The closest answers in Q6 is likely 

'If a user action fails silently, it can be fixed to inform the user of the problem.'

'Making user-facing info more specific/informative (e.g., changing a generic error message Command format is invalid into a more specific error message The parameter p/ in the command is not valid) is an enhancement i.e., not allowed.' or 

' Widening the scope of a message (or making it more general) is allowed. For example, suppose an error can be caused by a problem in parameters x, y, or z but the error message says problem in x or y. In this case the current error message is incomplete and hence you may widen its scope (e.g., problem in x or y or z) or make it more general (e.g., problem in parameters).' 

However, in this case there is an error message thrown but does not provide information to the user, the message is 'data\addressbook.json' which I think is the error message thrown by the IO exception which i then catch and throw the same message as a command exception. So I am uncertain which category it falls into. Since it's not completely silent since an error is thrown but is uninformative, but at the moment the actual error is not in the scope of the message as does not give any information, but changing it would be making the message more informative as there is currently no other general error message for that command.

The command is a backup command, the error occurs when there is no data file to backup, currently the only instance of this is when the program starts for the first time, or the user deletes the data file. The current error message is 'data\addressbook,json'.
The message that I would like to implement would be at "Backup failed, no data file found to backup." and if possible with additional information "If this is your first time starting the program or you have deleted the data file try another command first."

I used AI tools to aid me in autocompleting repetitive methods, some of those which looked very similar to other methods I written. This helped me to save a great deal of time in rewriting those code

I also attempted to use AI to refactor some of the code so it is more readable and neater, so as to utilise as much SLAP as possible

AI is a really useful tool and we should learn to utilise it to improve efficiency :D

For negatives, AI does generate wrong code and you have to spend time to undo the changes that may not be beneficial. This may result in more time than usual if there is over reliance. Hence, I wrote most of the code before using AI as a tool to support my learning!

2. Locate the file on your operating system and double-click to open it.
3. A Java program will run, welcoming you to use the application
4. Use commands like:
    `list`: Lists all added tasks
    `todo work`: Adds a new todo task with the description "work"

hi @yizhong187,

Thanks for your help on testing my product. However, I tried on my end it seems to work as intended. Could I trouble any other mac users to test on this issue? Thanks

If I need to reference the index number in a for loop within my UML sequence diagram, how should I go about it? I searched the course website but couldn't seem to find information about that.

For example, if I have a for loop 

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) ``{``
    EgClass.egFunc(i)
``}``
```
how do I represent the index i within my sequence diagram? Or is it simply unnecessary and I can write the function as `egFunc()` without the parameter? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

To add on for those not using SourceTree, I solved it on Windows 11 / IntelliJ by:

1. Creating a PAT that allows workflow in github
2. Going to IntelliJ > Settings > Version Control > Github > Sign in by token and adding the PAT
3. Going to Start > Settings > Windows Credentials manager and deleting my old git credentials

May I ask how to run the site locally? We were under the impression that github renders the .md file to a static HTML, but is there anyway for us to do that locally?
The DeveloperGuide.md works on our devices and within the github repo preview.

</div>

Why is it that C or E is not the correct answer? It seems to me that B, C, E are all correct, and among them, C is the most specific one.
The only difference between options C/E and option B is that options C/E has the `update(int)`. 
I thought that since from the given code, `ProgressWatcher` implements `Watcher`, the `update(int)` can be in both classes as shown in one of the examples in the CS2103T website.

you can try creating the new pull request from your fork (your_username/ip) instead of creating the pull request from the original upstream repo. i believe that should allow you to successfully create the new pull request.

I'm currently in the last stage of my progress but I just found out I have make a mistake at previous level. How can I solve it ? If I make changes, commit and retag the commit, I will have all the tag starting from that level up to my current level on a single commit and the file for each tag will be the latest product of my bot. Is it fine to do so ?

Hi, I have tried many times for text-ui testing. It runs correctly but it only give output like                  FC: no differences encountered
The expected result should be "Test result: PASSED" or "Test result: FAILED", what should I do to solve it ?

The issue is caused by the fact that default locale of my laptop is not English. If anyone is facing the same issue, adding an the `.withLocale` method to the end of `ofPattern` will solve the issue.

I think inheritance and interface implementation should be ignored as the object diagram will always show an object of parent class or child class but not both. But we can still show aggregation and composition as they can be legitimate relationship between instances.

Is it right to say

> There was actually a similar question in the week 8 part 1 quiz. Firstly, just to clarify it's not an association because Activity is not holding any objects or references to ProgressWatcher so it can't be a straight line. Secondly, Activity still depends on the variable Progresswatcher.MAX and so cannot compile without ProgressWatcher.

is it right to say the cannot compile condition is suitable to be drawn as a dependency (provided it is not an association)

**2. :fas-info-circle: Naming Booleans and their Getter Methods**
</div>

### Problem
When a class contains a private Boolean field (e.g. `isComplete`) and said Boolean is exposed via a getter method, it is intuitive to name the getter method as `isComplete()`. However, this would lead to a duplicate in naming as `isComplete` is already used to name the variable.

In this case, what would be a better way to name the Boolean variable and its corresponding getter method?

### Attempts at Resolution
1. My current implementation would name the Boolean field as `complete`, and its getter method would be named `isComplete()`.

2. However, it can be argued that naming both the Boolean field and the getter method `isComplete` and `isComplete()` respectively is also fine.
This is because accessing the variable directly and calling the getter method are syntactically different (one uses brackets, the other does not).
In addition, only `isComplete()` can be called from outside the class—assuming the appropriate data-hiding precautions are taken.

3. Another possible option could be to name it `isComplete` and to name its getter as `isIsComplete()`, but this sounds slightly silly to me. 

### Following Conventions
The [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/#naming) used in this course recommends that Boolean variables/methods should be named to sound like Booleans but makes no mention of cases like these. The [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) provided also does not address this issue. 

### External Sources
Google searches have yielded me some of these discussions on Stack Overflow:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5322648/for-a-boolean-field-what-is-the-naming-convention-for-its-getter-setter
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4851337/setter-for-a-boolean-variable-named-like-isactive
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49273722/what-should-be-the-name-of-getter-method-for-a-boolean-variable-starting-with-i

These posts mostly have answers that recommend solution 1, but seems to be based on the [JavaBeans Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans#Code_example) (see Boolean property `deceased`). Hence, it might not be applicable to the conventions used in this course.

### Help Needed
Has anyone encountered this issue with naming while working on their iP? If so, how did you to resolve it? Thanks in advance. :)

**3 :fas-comment:**
</div>

Thanks for your responses over the past few days. It has been helpful to see the different approaches taken to tackle this issue.

### Context
As requested by @tckeong, this question stems from the implementation of `Task` class in the iP, where a Boolean variable is required to keep track of its completion status.
```
public class Task ``{``
    private boolean isComplete; // the boolean of interest
    
    // a setter method which is used
    public void setComplete(boolean isComplete) ``{``
        this.isComplete = isComplete;
    ``}``

    // other methods that are not relevant
```
However, there has been no real need for a getter method to check for the Boolean `isComplete` in the iP. Hence, this question is **purely hypothetical** and has no real implications for the actual `Task` class.

### Suggestions
The suggestions provided have their own merit, but I cannot fully agree with some of them as the intent of the method would change with the change in naming.

> `getComplete()` and `getIsComplete()`.
- `getComplete()` and `getIsComplete()` follow the standard convention for getter methods but fails to comply with the coding standard where Boolean variables/methods should be named to sound like Booleans. These names do not immediately suggest that the method will return a Boolean value and could be possibly misinterpreted.

> `checkIsComplete()` indicates that the method checks if the task is complete.
- The method never checks if the task is complete—it only returns the Boolean variable. This could lead to a misinterpretation of the method's intent as well.

> `hasComplete()` provides an alternative name for the getter method.
- `hasComplete()` follows the convention for naming Boolean methods, but the word 'has' wouldn't sound like proper English when used in conditional statements, i.e. `if(task.hasComplete())`.
- Providing an alternative name also doesn't seem like good practice, since having multiple words that mean the same thing can confuse other readers (and yourself) as the codebase grows larger.
For example, `evaluate`, `calculate`, `determine` and `compile` are all verbs that could be used interchangeably and mean the same thing unless otherwise specified. `fetch`, `retrieve` and `get` is another good example.
- This inconsistent use of verbs would make it hard to keep track what concept/action each verb maps to.
As such, I can't fully agree with this approach either.

### Down to Preference
As it stands, I would still prefer my (and @psh12320's) approach of treating the private field as a flag `complete` and the getter method with the Boolean-sounding name of `isComplete()`, though this would be a biased opinion.

I believe that this is incredibly subjective and ultimately boils down to personal preference. At the end of the day, being consistent within the codebase would be the most important.

Will leave this issue as open for a few more days in case of more discussion, but will close it if there are no responses after this point. Thanks again for taking the time to chime in on this!

Your error might be related to the application failing to find the image files specified to be displayed. Perhaps your image files got renamed or moved to a new location?

This is my current implementation for loading the image files into the `Image` object.
```
private final Image botImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/lawrence.jpg"));
```
If I rename the image file's address to:
```
// changed to a .png file
private final Image botImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/lawrence.png"));
```

I encounter the same error as you as `lawrence.png` does not exist.
```
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Input stream must not be null
        at javafx.scene.image.Image.validateInputStream(Image.java:1137)
        at javafx.scene.image.Image.<init>(Image.java:704)
        at lawrence.ui.components.MainWindow.<init>(MainWindow.java:29)
        ... 23 more
```
However, it should be noted that I am unable to run `gradlew run` successfully when I encounter this error. If your image files were specified correctly, your issue is likely to stem from something else.

Try adding this to your run task


run ``{``

    jvmArgs = [

**1. :fas-info-circle: Design Patterns used by AB3**
</div>

Would it be right to say that AB3 uses the MVC, Observer, Facade and Singleton design patterns? 

MVC, Observer are straightforward and obvious.

For facade, I believe that `Storage` is an example of a Facade class. For example, `LogicManager` calls `storage.saveAddressBook(...)` after the execution of each command. It does not know about the details of how storage saves to disk. `Storage` is providing an interface here for `LogicManager` to use. 

For Singleton, am I right to say that the logger used in `MainApp` is an example of a singleton? Since it is declared `private static final` and is initialized using a factory method from `LogsCenter` which controls the instantiation of `Logger` objects.

I'm using switch expressions in my code - in this case, what would be the correct way to indent the case statements? 

Example:

```java
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
                    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
                    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
                    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
                    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; // how should this closing curly brace be indented?
```

or 

```java
TaskType taskType = 
    switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``;
```

Or are both acceptable?

@zaidansani 

I think your indentation example makes a lot of sense, and I think any regular JS/TS/React users (including myself) would  appreciate the familiarity of the indentation style (it looks just like any other arrow function). So I agree with your idea on this one. 

I would recommend anyone pondering about this issue to stay away from the first example that I showed. As Zaidan mentioned, if the variable name we are assigning to is very long, the case statements that have to align to the start of the switch statement will have a lot of leading whitespace, which I find only adds more mental load to the reader.

Furthermore, it would mean that different switch expressions would have different levels of indentation for their case statements, since the start of the switch statement depends on the length of the variable we're assigning to. It would be very difficult to align the case statement indentation across multiple switch expressions, let alone just two.

@damithc 

Thank you Prof! 👍🏻

On a related note, do the grading scripts only detect PRs merged into `master`? If we make PRs to features that are still in development on a separate branch from master, will they still count towards the weekly requirement?

@damithc May I clarify if "Make error messages more specific" under the Planned Enhancements is considered as "covering multiple things"?

No, I was referring the to `logger` variable in `MainApp.java`.

If you trace the method call to the core Java implementation for `Logger`, you will see that a `new Logger(...)` instance is created.

So can the fix be changing it to an image instead? because currently it is not. 
Or can I adjust the alignment of the UI to fix the truncate?

We are hesitant because of this.

So in short the user will not be able to see the text in _any way_.

Currently the truncated text occurs when ID have more than 2 digits, which is a bug that was not intended and does not respond even after resizing the window on the user side as the Column width is fixed on javafx. 

However, we are not sure if the fix will violate UI enhancement during the feature freeze as it involves changing alignments/ style change. The fix to this is by resizing the UI on javafx by making it wider/ or to change the "P" to a picture instead.

My first thought was to use enums as a way to manage logic flow for commands (`mark`, `unmark`, `todo`, etc.) and to handle the corresponding message for the Exception class. The use of switch-case rather than a huge chunk of if-else statements is a lot more readable imo!

Hi @arnav12344,

Try updating your `mainClass` attribute to `mainClass.set("Kayo.Kayo")` in `build.gradle` to correctly reference the class within its package.

On that note, the course convention is to use lower case for package names,  so do update the package name to `kayo`. 
After this change,  the `mainClass` attribute needs to be updated to  `mainClass.set("kayo.Kayo")` in `build.gradle` to reflect the new package name.

The final directory structure should look like this: `.../src/main/java/kayo/Kayo`, with the corresponding mainClass attribute set to `kayo.Kayo`.

@FlyingDonkeys Have you tried [reimporting the project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-or-module-wizard.html#create-from-sources)? That should help to re-create the `.idea` folder (I think?)

Could you also share what steps you've already tried? It will make it easier to know what has or has not been tried yet.

If nothing else works, you could always clone the repository in a new directory with `git clone` and import it into IntelliJ.

> Will this affects encapsulation of the class? Also I tried using stubs but it seems quite weird to reimplement a lot of same classes in each class

Hmm, my train of thought was also to use mocks/stubs. You could extend the original class and override existing methods/write new methods that you need to control/inspect so I don't think there should be that much reimplementation.

Maybe you could try something like this?
```java
public class TaskListStub extends TaskList ``{``
    private List<Task> tasksStub = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Override some existing method to modify behaviour for testing
    @Override
    public void addTask(Task task) ``{``
        tasksStub.add(task);
    ``}``
    
    // Additional method to check for the modified behaviour without
    // implementing a getter in TaskList to access private fields.
    public boolean wasTaskAdded(Task task) ``{`` 
        return tasksStub.contains(task);
    ``}``
``}``
```
The added method `wasTaskAdded()` avoids the use of a getter in the original `TaskList`. You could probably add similar methods to handle logic related to the private fields. Not sure if this is what you are looking for but hope this helps!

It seems that the warnings are due to the runners using outdated Node.js versions, rather than an issue with your code itself. Since the workflows are working fine, I'm pretty sure the warnings can be ignored.

However, if the warnings bothers you, you can avoid them by upgrading the versions in the `.yml` file:
1) [Upgrade gradle/wrapper-validation-action  to gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v4](https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action?tab=readme-ov-file)
2) [Upgrade setup-java to v2](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/blob/main/docs/switching-to-v2.md)

It should look something like this? (Copy at your own risk, untested)
```diff
 - name: Validate Gradle Wrapper
-  uses: gradle/wrapper-validation-action@v3
+  uses: gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v4

 - name: Setup JDK 17
-  uses: actions/setup-java@v1
+  uses: actions/setup-java@v2
   with:
+    distribution: 'zulu'
     java-version: '17'

Hi! Maybe you can try running the command using `./gradlew run --debug` on your terminal. You will likely be met with a very verbose output. Search for sections named [ERROR] and it would point to exact location of error and we can try and find out the solution to the problem from there. There might be better ways to debug this but this is what I did when I encountered errors. Hope it helps!

I think we can name the private boolean field as `isComplete` and the corresponding getter method as either `getComplete()` or `hasComplete()`. So it provides an alternative name for the getter method while still implying the same meaning and purpose.

Hi! I searched up the web and found possible reasons why this could happen. 

If we type `git add *`, Git will add all files in the current directory to the staging area except for those that are listed in the `.gitignore` file or those that match the patterns defined in it. 

The .gitignore file may not be added to the staging area when you run `git add *` because of the following reasons:
- The `.gitignore`file is ignored by another `.gitignore` entry
- The `.gitignore` file is not in the directory where you're running `git add *`
- The `.gitignore` file was already added and committed previously

To explicitly add `.gitignore` file, we can run `git add .gitignore`. To add all modified files including `.gitignore` we can simply run `git add .`

Hope this helps!

Hi! 
The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a mismatch between the versions of the Java runtime you are using and the version of the JavaFX library in the project. It seems like you are using Java 8. To double check run `java --version` or you can go to `File -&gt; Project Structure` in IntelliJ and check that the SDK you are using is **Java 17**. If not, switch the SDK to Java 17. But if you are using Mac then specific **Azul JDK 17** distribution must be used, just having Java 17 would not suffice. You may follow [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to install the specific SDK. Once installed, you can go back to project structure and select `zulu-17` as your SDK instead.

Hope this helps!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Should tags accumulate over time?**
</div>


Hey alls,

I have noticed that in my process of tagging, my older commits are getting many, many tags:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c861b80-3f12-4118-a227-b799138117f2)
Most recent commit

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a7d7bc5-dd12-45ae-be93-c2b4c58e8c36)
Level 3 commit - but the subsequent tags are also present =O

I am asking around if anyone has also noticed this in their ip. In case it is relevant, I am using the GUI provided by IntelliJ and adding my tags from there. If so, do you think this is a desirable or expected use of tags?

Hi Prof and all, thanks for your inputs! I have switched over and tried the tagging using just the CLI - the same thing occurs. I have verified that my tags are stationary as they should be.

It seems that this is some quirk of GitHub, which displays all tags that are downstream from that release. Here are other people in the wild facing this quirk as well:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50542908/git-tag-tags-all-the-previous-commits-as-well
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59308676/multiple-git-tags-appear-in-software-release-on-github

But I wonder why this is something that github has?

Tested on mac.

2 main bugs:
Commands that start with a trailing space arent handled as errors (Currently, error message only works if first character is a letter)

I think the text storage mechanism to make storage persistent may not be working as well.

Please do come and try my release [here](https://github.com/josh1248/ip/releases/tag/BCD-Extension]) . It has default commands (no user guide yet 😅)

Yep, had the same issue and solution as @tanwartushar. If you are using a mac, do rmb to install a package manager first - a good one is Homebrew at https://brew.sh/ , then afterwards can run `brew install graphviz`. (My solution for Macbook M2)

In this first Image, I had my main class in one of my chatbot classes. I thought I could initialise my chatbot that way but it resulted in the error shown above. 
In the second Image, I created the launcher class as show in tutorial 1 and my code could run. 
In the first part of the tutorial it is stated that the launcher class is used to work around a classpath issue but they didnt go into detail as to why. Could be something else though im not too sure myself

I'm not too sure about this but from what I can gather online, an abstract class implementing an interface need not override the methods declared in the interface. However, the classes that extend from the abstract class have to implement all the methods the interface the abstract class implements.

Hi profs, currently my team's application has a UI error when users edit the data file manually. For a correct use case, pinned users should appear at the top of the UI. However if users manually edit the pinned parameter and starts the application, it does not appear at the top of the UI like it should. I believe my question would fall under this category however I would just like to double confirm whether fixing this would be considered violating the feature freeze.

Hello! It works fine on windows too! Just a few comments:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc3b7ac-bdab-45b7-a837-11f979052f5c)

- A welcome message would be good so that I know that the application has started and is running!
- There is a typo in the user guide: "create a deadline task ... /by TASK_NAME DATE" there should not be the `TASK_NAME` after `/by`. 
- And you mentioned according to the user guide that find needs to contain the full word. However, when I input `list ce` it returns me the correct tasks as shown in the screenshot below. So maybe you might need to change the user guide as well!

Hello! I am a windows user too and it works fine! 

Maybe you could provide a welcome message with the list of functions it can do because currently if I do not know what commands there are, I would not be able to do anything with the application. It helps to improve your usability!

Hello! I am using Windows and it is working fine! However, I do have some comments that you could take a look at as well:

- According to the GUI, the date must be keyed in `yyyy-dd-MM` for creating new events. However, when I did so, I got this error in my terminal saying that the range of 20 is out of bounds from 1-12. It likely means that the input format is `yyyy-MM-dd` instead. Do take a look at the screenshot attached below!
- There are a few formatting errors as well as shown in the second screenshot below.

**1. :fas-info-circle: How much of the burden of proof lies on the tester?**
</div>



There is one bug that I've written that isn't very well substantiated. It brings up an example of incorrect parsing that inconveniences the user slightly. However, the same problem with parsing extends to other commands and other cases.

In this case, would it be more appropriate to mark the bug as a low severity (since I only gave an example of a single command that isn't too deleterious) or a medium severity (since the same problem being identified in the bug exists with multiple other commands too, despite me not having elaborated on it)?

</div>



After the PE, I realised that I had written the title of one of my bugs wrongly, writing "invalid" when I had meant to write "valid". This is likely to cause some confusion for the team when reading it, though the description of the bug will make sense in of itself.

Is there a way to rectify this or communicate this to them? Or will it simply result in a rejection of the bug?

**3. :fas-info-circle: Difference between gitk graphic and course website graphic**
</div>



Hello, I'm currently working on W3.1b RCS: Branching. In the course instructions (step 9), the branch graphic shown is as shown below:
<img width="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2cd71db-023d-4654-9211-501700a35cfa">

However, when I check the branch graphic with gitk, I get the graphic as shown below.

I'm not sure if this reflects a problem, or is just a difference between how Sourcetree and gitk represents the branches. For reference, I'm using git on the CLI. Does anyone else working with the CLI have this same discrepancy, or have I done something wrong somewhere?

Thank you both for the responses!
I used Sourcetree to scan for the repository and look at the branch structure there, which gave me this graphic below:

</div>



> Can we tweak UI text (i.e., error/help messages or other text shown to the user)?
> - **If a user action fails silently**, it can be fixed to inform the user of the problem.

Regarding tweaking UI text, my team has a "type anything to cancel" function. The function correctly cancels if anything is typed, but if the user types a non-command word, an `Unknown command` error is also (correctly) shown.

Therefore, this behaviour can probably be considered to "succeed silently". Currently, the message is:
```
Unknown command! 
```
but ideally, the message shown should be:
```
You have cancelled the ___ command.
Unknown command!                                      <- not strictly necessary
```

Is this a fixable bug for feature freeze?

**3. :fas-info-circle: Handling an abnormal input in a different way, can fix or cannot fix?**
</div>


One of my team's commands has two related (same input field) but different bugs reported.
1) Input does not handle integer overflow/large integers like `9999999999999`, the app does not do anything or return any error message (app misbehaves)
2) Input does not handle inputs with leading zeros, returns an empty list, but behaves properly (doesn't crash, etc).

I will accept Bug 1 since it is a functionality bug that breaks the app, but the input is not a normal usage. But if I fix Bug 1, Bug 2 will be slightly affected due to sharing the same validation (they are both the same input field).

More specifically, before the change, the app accepts leading zeros and returns an empty list. After the change, the app does not accept numbers with more than 3 digits, and therefore doesn't accept most inputs with leading zeros.

The constraint of the input field is NOT limited to 3 digits, it is just a side effect of the range of numbers accepted.

In this case, can I fix Bug 2 since it is _now rejecting valid inputs_, or cannot fix since (before fixing Bug 1) it simply _accepts seemingly 'unsuitable' values_.

Edit: We would say that inputs with leading zeros are valid but unsuitable and not normal usage.

Hi @gabriellegtw, not sure if this is directly related to your error, but your `application` in build.gradle is pointing to `Launcher` without the package. (I'm using terminal to run gradle so I'm unable to replicate the exact error)

You can try change to the following and see if the error still persist:
```java
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
``}``
```

Hope this helps.

I will be closing this.

Looking closer at the bugs we are allowed to fix, I noticed that "give incorrect results" is an allowed-to-fix bug. While the input may be unsuitable, our application returns an empty list which can and should considered an incorrect result.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Planned enhancement immune from bugs**
</div>

I would like to clarify on what was meant by planned enhancement are immune from bugs. 

The team I have tested has a feature in which they advertised will work a certain way (sort alphabetically) in their UG. However, their implementation of sort was case-sensitive and resulted in the sorted list to not be returned alphabetically (Bernice Yu comes before aaron). 

However, the team did include for sort to be case-insensitive in the planned enhancement section of the DG. 

I personally think that for this case, this would not make the team immune from the bug as they have included in the DG? Since the feature was not as advertised in the UG at all (returned list is not in alphabetical order), I believe that it should count as a functional bug. 

However I would like to clarify with the teaching team on this issue, as well as whether I had misunderstood the purpose of planned enhancement. Thank you.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Can the omission of an abbreviation for our target user be considered NotInScope?**

If our team’s target users are ABC administrators who are already familiar with the abbreviation "ABC," can the issue of not explicitly defining it in the UG be considered VeryLow? (throughout the entire UG we did not state what ABC stands for despite multiple usages of the abbreviation throughout as well) 

What our team thinks is that since the UG is designed specifically for these users, who would already know what the abbreviation stands for, and given that "ABC" is a common abbreviation with no alternative meanings, there would be no confusion and the omission does not hinder the usage of the UG.

Changing the result message from "x persons listed!" to:

- "x persons listed!" if there 2 or more results returned

I believe that the change does not make user-facing information more specific/informative, and it falls under the approved grammar instead.

Our implementation of a command with the format :`upcoming aft/START_DATE bef/END_DATE` specified in the user guide submitted for PE-D allows users to enter a START_DATE that is later than an END_DATE and does not show any error message.

Example: the user intends to search for a delivery between 19-02-2023 08:00 and 19-02-2024 08:00. However, the user may accidentally input upcoming aft/19-02-2024 08:00 bef/19-02-2023 08:00 and get the wrong results

> Hi @chengzihao123, I'm a senior from your previous batch. You mention that you're using Java 17.0.7. That might be the potential issue... try changing your sdk to java 11 and see if it resolves this!

HI! I have tried to switching to java 11 but I still faced the same error.

Hi everyone so much for your help! The issue is that I didn't download the JavaFX SDK. After downloading and putting it under JavaFX folder the run command works perfectly fine!

Hi I also faced the same issue. The warning says that the URL is not registered. What you need to do is to go to `Settings` -&gt; `Languages & Frameworks` -&gt; `Schemas and DTDs`. Under the `Ignored schemas and DTDs` section click on `+` and then you copy and paste the URL inside. After that the warning would go off.

Hello. I would like to check if the JUnit tests can be deleted or changed after GUI has been implemented. 

In my case, I had to change some other methods to adapt to a GUI and as such, the JUnit tests have compilation errors and will need to be changed as well.

When the iP is graded, do the markers check the JUnit tests before Level-10 or the tests at the end?

I was trying to understand the differences in exception handling offered by `java.nio.file` vs `java.io.File` and would like to know which package is more recommended.

It seems that the exceptions in `java.nio.file` are more specific than in `java.io.File`. For example, when `duke.txt` is not found, the former would throw a `NoSuchFileException` compared to the latter which would throw an `IOException`.

Is there any recommendation or are we free to experiment and change along the way?

Here are the steps I took to resolve this error:

1. Copy-paste the links on the internet. 

2. Once done, the files `configuration_1_3.dtd` and `suppressions_1_2.dtd` will be downloaded. 

3. You can paste those files within the same `config/checkstyle` folder as `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.xml`.

4. After doing the above, you can write the following code instead:

``` xml
<!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC
        "-//Checkstyle//DTD Checkstyle Configuration 1.3//EN"
        "configuration_1_3.dtd">

```

The same can be done for `suppressions.xml`.

There will be no longer be any URI not registered error.

I believe solution 1 is the cleanest and most 'intuitive' approach. 

By naming the boolean field `complete` and its getter method as `isComplete()`, we maintain clarity and adhere to the coding standard of having method names that represent an action. Additionally, the field name remains easy to understand and intuitive for developers even though it doesn't contain a prefix. 

Other solutions such as using `getIsComplete()` as a getter method name is rather verbose for something seemingly simple and may not easy for developers to grasp. 

I think that solution 1 is balanced in terms of being readable and complying with coding standards.

Then again, in CS2103T, we should be following the coding standards given here regardless. 
Rationale: Just follow it 😝

The problem is that the team that opened issue #444 was deploying from master branch, while the image above is deploying from gh-pages branch, which by default does not have a /docs folder.

Yes. When you run git push while on a branch without specifying the remote (like origin) or the branch name, Git will automatically push to the branch's corresponding remote branch. This works because Git keeps track of the relationship between your local branch and its upstream counterpart on the remote. Typically, when you create a new branch off of a remote branch or when you clone a repository, Git will set up this tracking relationship for you. So, as long as your branch is tracking the correct remote branch, you can simply use git push without any extra arguments, and it will push to the appropriate remote branch by default.

Hey @jevan13, it could also be worth checking your Git settings for line ending conversions, like core.autocrlf. Sometimes Git modifies line endings based on your OS, which might explain why it looks fine in IntelliJ but not on GitHub.

I have a function in my `Command` class that has the following function prototype `Response execute(TaskList tasks, Ui ui, Storage storage)` which I want to perform J-Unit test on to ensure it returns the right Response.

My understanding is that I am supposed to create a stub for `TaskList`, `Ui`, and `Storage`. However, none of these classes implements any interface. Nonetheless, within these classes, it still needs to have all the public methods found in their class right (regardless if it will be used or not). These methods will be a simple implementation such as returning null. 

May I check if my understanding for the J-Unit testing with stubs correct? Else, how would you test the function as stated above? Thank you!

For those struggling with styling of your code, you can use IDEA's auto formatter.

For Windows : Ctrl + Alt + L
For Ubuntu : Ctrl + Alt + Windows + L
For Mac : ⌥ (Option) + ⌘ (Command) + L

You can change the default style configurations using File > Setting > Editor > Code Style.
For instance, to change IDEA auto formatter such that the indentation for `switch` and `case` is aligned, you can specify it here:
<img width="728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20383cf7-1629-42cc-84da-892ebfd83de5">

Do note that while you can use the auto formatters to automate certain aspects of the code style, you still need be familiar with coding standards because other aspects such as naming convention cannot be automated.

Hello, may I know if an association line could be branched out like this in object diagrams because the equivalent class diagram would have represented this with a single line?

Hi Prof, [previously](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/599) you said that we are allowed to use pseudocode in our diagrams to omit the low-level implementation details so that it is easier for users to understand. May I ask if we can do so here too? We understand that conditional statements are done via the `opt` block but including this will expose additional low-level details such as exception-handling.

Hi, 
Could I clarify if certain instances of AB3 terms were not replaced (e.g. the json file not renamed to new product name but left as addressbook), would this be considered a bug? Or is it considered acceptable in this course (since the product was developed from AB3)? Thank you!

Under feature flaws, it is stated that making keywords case-sensitive when there is no need for it is considered a feature flaw. 
Could I clarify what does keyword here refer to? Taking the add command for example, does it mean that the `add` command word should not be case-sensitive, or that even its prefixes (e.g. `n/`, `p/` , `e/` etc.) should not be case-sensitive as well? (i.e. `ADD N/NAME p/PHONE...` should be accepted as valid input for add command).  Thank you!

Hi, when referring to the textbook it was mentioned that if method parameters don't matter to the purpose of the sequence diagram, we can omit them using ... e.g., use foo(...) instead of foo(int size, double weight). I would like to clarify to specify only some parameters or only a partial parameter, is such notation accepted? e.g. for foo (int x, String y, int z) use foo(..., 1) to show only one parameter z and for goo(String s) use goo("a ...") to represent a partial parameter instead of the full String input.

Thanks for your input! Did your group also interpret prefixes to be keywords?

i.e. `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL ...` and `add N/NAME P/PHONE E/EMAIL...` should both be accepted where `n/`, `p/` and `e/` are the prefixes and are `N/` , `P/` and `E/` when capitalized.

Building on what RezwanAhmed123 said, going off what is available in the course materials magic numbers should be fine if it is clear what the magic number represents. At the same time, I'll wager its probably best not to use it as far as possible given that the naming convention at the [Week 4 topics page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/topics.html#w4-6-code-quality-naming) specify that names like label1 label2 are already frowned upon.

Not exactly sure if this is good, but what I essentially did was inject the stage into the `MainWindow` like how the Duke equivalent was injected into it with *MainWindow#setDuke*, then had *MainWindow#handleUserInput* detect when the user input was "bye" ( or when Duke / your equivalent responded with the bye message) and invoke the *Stage::close* function of the injected stage. 

This seemed to work as typing "bye" would close the window. The handleExit method sounds neater though!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Unable to resolve javafx in fxml file**
</div>

# Context
Hi! I'm currently on the last step of the JavaFX tutorial. However, for some reason my fxml files have multiple errors as my javafx and related classes are unable to be resolved. (I'm using Intellij on Windows btw)

More specifically, the below import statements are unable to be resolved:

```fxml
<?import javafx.scene.layout.AnchorPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.TextField?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.VBox?>
```

This is a screengrab of the error messages:
<img width="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9b40fb7-1458-4903-a40f-a2f42e845b7e">


# Steps taken (that did not work)

I have followed the other parts of the tutorial exactly up to this point. I have searched how to resolve this on the web and done the below to try to resolve it (but it still showed the same issues):

- Ensuring that I am using the correct JDK/SDK
- Clearing Intellij cache
- Ensuring that my file directory structures are correctly set up
- Ensuring that my files are marked correctly (eg. marking resources folder as a resources folder)
<img width="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e99a8733-c4da-4fc3-ace6-4788b29c1d8d">

- Ensuring that `fx:controller` correctly points to duke.MainWindow (as I placed it in a package)
- Ensuring that javafx plugin is enabled in Intellij

I have also tried editing the build.gradle file, but to no avail:

Initially, this was my build.gradle file:

Hi @QinHaichen12 

Thanks for commenting! No, those are not all the errors. Here is the full list:

_NOTE: Ignore the fact that the last error says "MainWindow" instead of "duke.MainWindow", I've shifted around some files on my local repo since the time I've posted this (It previously said "duke.MainWindow" when I posted this query because everything was packaged within duke). 

Previously, changing "duke.MainWindow" to anything else (eg. "MainWindow") leads to more errors. So I suspect the problem lies with javafx and not so much the file structure, but I may be wrong._

Okay I have resolved the issue and I'm putting it here in case anyone needs it. 

1. Ensure that the "resources" file is marked as a source file and not a resource file. You can do this by checking that the file icon next to the word resources looks like this:
<img width="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1081bdf-ddaf-4bab-a9d4-d234daee488c">

(Initially mine had a yellow logo instead)

2. Not sure if this affects anything, but I also ensured that the Main, MainWindow, DialogBox and Launcher classes were outside my `duke` package

3. If you're using Intellij, right click on the import statements and select "Show Context Actions". There should be a list of actions that appears (mainly adding different modules and dependencies). I just clicked on each one until the error messages all went away.

Thanks @damithc , @k-hian and @QinHaichen12 for help on this!

I believe it is because the `Activity` class references `ProgressWatcher` class when we declare the `watchers` variable (ie. through `ProgressWatcher.MAX`)

I think discussions can be left open until they are no longer relevant (for example, not much point in having a discussion about Level-2 work now). For `tips` I think we can close them after a few days - 1 week.

As for repeated questions, I think we can add a pinned comment/issue at the top (like the [AB3 crashes on Mac issue #146](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/146) that says something along the lines of "Have a question? Read this first" and then just describes how to search through the issues for a potential answer. Like how on other online forums (reddit, ed etc.) there is a ruleset pinned somewhere on the page that explains to people to first search to see if their question has already been answered before asking it. This could also work for multiple tips (either a separate pinned issue or inside the same issue).

@Arren11111 You might want to try printing the stack trace upon error using `e.printStackTrace()`. That might help you find the error.

Of the top of my head, it could be because you're missing this line in your `gradle.build` file:
```gradle
run ``{``
    standardInput = System.in
``}``
```
This makes sure that the standard input is set to the console when using `gradlew run`

Edit: Seems like you do have it. I downloaded your code and it seems to work fine. Is the issue resolved?

Is it directly using the `docs/README.md` file from your repository? If it isn't, you may have typo-ed something. From the screenshot you shared, it seems like the table is entirely missing and there is just a closing `</table>` tag. That might be causing parsing issues and may be the reason your markdown is not being rendered.

If that still doesn't work, try to use pipe characters for your table instead of using the `<table>` tags. [Here is how this works](https://diplodoc.com/docs/en/syntax/tables/gfm).

Basically just try to look for some inconsistency - unpaired brackets/backticks/tags, extra space etc.

Glad I could help!

Unfortunately I'm not too sure why tasklists and alerts are not being processed since both kramdown and GFM support them (and with the same syntax, as far as I can tell). I'll keep looking, but if anyone else has figured out the solution feel free to jump in.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Omitted user stories reported as bug**
</div>

**Context:** we have 4 roles in our app: Person, Volunteer, Donor, Partner. our current user story includes `add` and `delete` for volunteers.
<img width="953" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-17 at 3 40 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c022e80d-efbd-4548-a148-e18cfc8e2152">


However, bugs have been raised regarding not having user stories for adding and deleting for other roles. We think that this can be omitted because they are highly similar by nature, and do not constitute a documentation bug. I would really appreciate opinions from the teaching team on this matter. What would be the suggested way to deal with them? Can we reject them or classify them as `NotInScope`? If they are considered bugs, can we classify them as duplicates? Thank you.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on LSP and Role-Specific Field Editing Behavior**
</div>

**Description:**

Our team is working on a feature where users can manage contacts with different roles: `Volunteer` (subclass of `Person`), `Donor` (subclass of `Person`), `Partner` (subclass of `Person`), and `Person` (default). Each role has specific fields, such as `hours` for Volunteers and `donatedAmount` for Donors.

**Our concern:**

Allowing users to edit role-specific fields for the wrong role (e.g., editing `hours` for a non-Volunteer) could cause bugs. However, if we throw an error in these cases, would that be seen as violating the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)?

Since the `edit` function should ideally work across all instances of `Person` and its subclasses, would enforcing role-specific validation (i.e., throwing an error when users attempt to edit a field not applicable to the instance) violate LSP?

Any insights on this would be greatly appreciated!

**3. :fas-info-circle: Are we supposed to fork the original tp repo, or the newly created team tp repo?**

Hi, I am a bit confused here.
The tp task for week 6 says that:
```
Fork the tp repo to your personal GitHub account.
```

I forked the **team tp repo** but the dashboard failed to detect it. So I am wondering if there is a misunderstanding here. Is it actually referring to the **original tp repo**  or **team tp repo**? Thanks!

In CS2030, we have to make every object immutable, and every attribute needs to be declared as "final." Is that the case in this course too?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Adding tests for UI components**
</div>


I was working on the next iteration of the tp and sent a PR only for it to fail Codecov's test coverage. After looking at the areas where coverage is supposed to be missing, I found that majority of the missing coverage was in the UI components I have added to the project. I presumed that UI components were not required to be tested as the tp's original code had no tests for the UI components, but I might have to to pass Codecov's check. Is there any way to write tests for these components?

Hi @yizhong187, 

I have tested your application on windows and it runs. Here is a screenshot of how it's looking on my PC.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d2ca415-5ed4-4d8c-8594-60ba63b1c20d)
However, I also encountered the bug @Chronoxy found, in which I could not mark or unmark the task that was third in the list. In my case, the task was a todo, so I think it might be something to do with mark/unmark and the tasklist. I tried to delete the third task and it worked.

**1. :fas-info-circle: UML Diagrams: which is better between these two?**
</div>

Hello friends.

Here's two dummy diagrams I made which represents my problem in a high-level format:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f69e8bd-e3f9-472b-976d-99f3fe56bace)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bb4653a-0ac1-4694-8601-e79cde22425f)

I have two questions: both diagrams seem 'correct' (read: nothing wrong with them) to me, but I want to know if any of you have two cents to give regarding whether two or one merge nodes in this scenario is better. It should be noted that I can't seem to have only one merge node to make it look better.

Secondly, for the diagram with two branch nodes, is the second branch node acceptable? Instead of using `[else]`, is using `[!booleanCheck]` valid? I think that as booleanCheck is a boolean here, it is alright as it's a binary question: there's no ambiguity, similar to the examples given in the CS2103T website with `[x => 5]` and `[x &lt; 5]` as guard clauses.

Thanks in advance.

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡Duke A-TextUiTesting: cmd window closing too fast, and my solution**
</div>

Hello friends, just wanting to share an experience in doing Week 2's project tasks.

I found that the cmd window opened and closed too fast for me to see the result of the comparison in the .bat file, and I learnt that adding 'pause' at the end of the .bat file keeps the cmd window open for you. Just throwing this out for everyone else on Windows, so you don't have to check both EXPECTED.TXT and ACTUAL.TXT manually.

> From my opinion, I feel like the first diagram is more concise and easier to read, as the both of the conditions has to be true to execute the intended behavior. while if one of it is false, it will skip the execution of the behavior. It seems a bit redundant to include another branch node as it doesn't result in a different branch/behaviour if valid argument is true and boolean check is false. Hence, I think there is not necessary to have another branch node to indicate the second condition check. But actually diagram 2 might also create a bit of ambiguity in the second diagram, which will be explain below

Hmm, I was of the idea that in the spirit of concise code, a boolean in a guard clause can be expressed without using `== true`
For example,
`if (isPresent == true) ``{`` ... ``}```
and 
`if (isPresent) ``{`` ... ``}```
are equivalent. I feel that if it's clear to the developer/user that what is being checked is a boolean, in this example `isPresent`, it should be fine to leave it as so. Thanks again for your inputs.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Functionality Bug vs Feature Flaw**
</div>

if an invalid index e.g. `-1` is passed into a command and the error states "Invalid command format!", but the **Developer Guide** (not the User Guide) states that "an error message that the index is out of range" should be shown, should it be more of a feature flaw or functionality bug?

According to the course website, app behavior differing from the UG (in this case, the behavior differed from the specification in the DG's use case) is considered a functionality bug. Is it also then a functionality bug if the app behavior differs from what's specified in the DG?
<img width="710" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-20 at 12 21 01 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/357e12ff-8f13-427e-b7b6-555d05bb8506">

But, at the same time, the website also states that "Calling an invalid value a 'format error' and vice versa is a severity.Low bug" under the list of example feature flaws:
<img width="655" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-20 at 12 19 42 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7780aa46-d7a3-4e30-85b5-f1b02082da8f">

The definition for wrong error message seems to overlap between feature flaw and functionality bug, so I'd like to clarify how this bug should be categorized. Thanks!

Hi, the course website states

>  A step gives the intention of the actor (not the mechanics). That means UI details are usually omitted. The idea is to leave as much flexibility to the UI designer as possible. That is, the use case specification should be as general as possible (less specific) about the UI.

Would it be a bug if the 3rd step of the MSS was changed to something that includes the user inputs required for the bank transfer, e.g. `User enters the amount and bank account number for the transaction`? Or would such non-UI details be acceptable in the Use Case MSS?

**5. :fas-info-circle: Does it SLAP to use monads to abstract programming constructs?**

Hi everybody, we had learnt to abstract lines of code into a logical sequence of methods to achieve SLAP. I had noticed that my own code uses a lot of `if ( ) ``{`` ``}`` ... else ``{`` ``}``` or `try ``{`` ``}`` catch ( ) ``{`` ``}``` or the various loops. Will abstracting these constructs, say changing the conditional construct to `Conditional.of().ifBlock(&lt;condition>, &lt;method to execute>).elseBlock(&lt;method to execute>)` be following SLAP? Also, is doing this good practice?

Good job on your iP, maybe you could pass you instructions message as a separate text instead of stating everything at in your introduction text. You could also see if you can add a condition in your list printing method to print that there's no tasks in the list when 0 tasks as now it prints an empty list.

Hello, this is my version graph when I type in git log --graph --oneline

Referring to the tips for troubleshooting, my current branches look like this. I have went to some individual branches and pulled from the remote repository. Then, I removed the jar file before committing and pushing back to the branch.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47377f14-ee7c-497c-90e7-7420e563fabf)
Im afraid to merge it to my current master branch as it might mess up my finished IP.

I have went to each individual branch and ensured that they are the latest version before pushing the branch again to the remote repository. Then I went to master branch and merged them 1 by 1 whilst resolving the merge conflicts. This ensured that all my branches are merged to my master branch.

Now my commits have the second number as 0.

Does this solve the problem? Waiting to check for the IP dashboard tomorrow.

Hi prof thanks for the quick reply.
I apologise but i forgot to mention that i tried `./data/tasks.txt` and `data/tasks.txt` as well and it doesnt work 😭

# Bug: Lost Progression
It seems like something might have broke in the most recent update for the iP Progress Dashboard as all the progress for some students like myself have lost all tracked progress that we had on our iP. Unsure if this may affect us in any way but making this issue to clarify.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Go to https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/dashboards/contents/ip-progress.html
2. View a number of profiles with similar 0 commits, tag-less, and lost progression similar to the screenshot above

Hi, I assume when you mean committing 2 files at once, you mean adding 2 files to a commit.

I'm not sure what's the guidelines or recommendations are for this course, so hope someone could fill me in on this as well. Personally, I would complete all my work for each Level before adding/staging them all into one commit with a general description of what I have done for the commit (like a major revision/change). After staging them, I would add the tag for the level and push them all to my forked repo. Would probably be easier for you to view the key changes you have made for each level increment in a single commit and leaving minor bug fixes as extra commits thereafter.

Hi. I did not use any IDEs for git, utilised terminal to commit and tag my commits manually with `git tag Level-6` and so on, I see similar tags on my older commits on Github as well. My interpretation is that Github shows the tag on the current commit as well as subsequent/child tags as I have checked using `gitk` that I'm not tagging on multiple commits. I have also verified using `git show` and `git checkout` to check out different tags and showing the commit info. This is what I got:

**2. :fas-info-circle: Change header in PDF for User Guide**
</div>

**Description**:  
While converting my project’s user guide (an HTML file) to PDF via the browser’s `Ctrl + P` print function, an unexpected "AB-3" text appears in the header of the PDF. This text doesn’t appear in the HTML source code or in the page title, and it only shows up when printing to PDF.

**Context**:  
- The HTML file name is unrelated to "AB-3" and does not contain any references to the old project name.
- I’ve tried clearing the browser cache and disabling "Headers and Footers" in the print settings, yet "AB-3" still appears in the header when printing to PDF.

**Steps Taken So Far**:
1. Verified that the HTML `&lt;title>` tag is correctly set to "User Guide."
2. Checked the browser’s print settings and disabled "Headers and Footers" but still encountered the issue.

**Expected Behavior**:  
The PDF should display the current title "User Guide" without any reference to "AB-3."

**Questions**:
- Has anyone experienced a similar issue or knows where else the "AB-3" might be coming from?
- Are there any additional steps I can take to ensure the browser doesn’t pull old metadata when printing to PDF?

**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡You can fix trailing whitespace issues in your source code with a single command**

While running checkstyle on my codebase a frequent issue was that I would get the error `Line matches the illegal pattern 'Trailing whitespace'.` Manually checking for these is painful because the human eye cannot easily see a trailing whitespace.

You can run the following command

# For Mac users
Use the following command and replace `filename` with the relative path of the file
```bash
sed -i '' 's/[ \t]*$//' test.txt
``` 
You can even put all the filenames in a txt file and then do
```bash
while read -r file; do
    sed -i '' 's/[ \t]*$//' "$file"
done < filelist.txt
```

# For Linux users
Use the below command on your terminal
```
sed -i 's/[ \t]*$//' filename
```
You can even put all the filenames in a txt file and then do
```bash
while read -r file; do
    sed -i 's/[ \t]*$//' "$file"
done < filelist.txt
```

# For Windows Users
You can use the below PowerShell command

```PowerShell
(Get-Content filename) | ForEach-Object ``{`` $_.TrimEnd() ``}`` | Set-Content filename
```
Or you can use the below for a list of files stored in a txt file
```PowerShell
Get-Content filelist.txt | ForEach-Object ``{``

In the [course notes for week 3](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#W3-1) there is a broken link to the [external site](https://initialcommit.com/blog/what-is-git-head) mentioned. Specifically in this section

</div>

So for one of my bug reports I suggested an improvement that would make a feature more useful than can be and placed it under `FeatureFlaw`. The team's response was that they actually had created a command that included this improvement already but they pretty much forgot to document it down in their UG or Help Window and that the bug type should be `DocumentationBug`. I am unsure whether to accept or challenge this type change as on the one hand it could be a `DocumentationBug` under the category of **Undocumented Features**, but on the other hand, I feel like I am unjustly losing marks for accuracy as there was actually no way for me to know that they actually already had this feature improvement somewhere hidden in their app unless I was to stumble across it accidentally.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Indentation for Case Clauses in Coding Standards**
</div>

Hi everyone,

I would like to seek clarification regarding the coding standard for switch statements, specifically the indentation of case clauses.

The coding standard specifies that **case clauses should not be indented**, but the example provided to illustrate this seems to contradict the rule, as it shows indented case clauses. 
<img width="726" alt="626392e265b3e6c93c00706687b5d85" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/804b995b-7816-41ac-94e7-791d085d6a8e">

This inconsistency was also pointed out in _Quiz 3, Question 16_, where the same example was **marked as unacceptable**. This has caused some confusion for me in understanding the expected style.
<img width="726" alt="c5589c1b884304b0c35d1a9b4dc7ce7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9311a8-1298-4c8b-a9c7-425da710e8f1">

Could someone kindly confirm if the following is the correct style under the requirement?
```
switch (condition) ``{``
case ABC:
statements;
break;

case DEF:
statements;
break;

case XYZ:
statements;
break;

default:

break;
``}``

It seemed the original problem was with javafx.application.Application being in the original Launcher class. After refactoring my Launcher class to not include Application and then rebuilding with `./gradlew clean shadowjar`, the problem appears to have been resolved.

Our group has a `schedule` command, with the relevant parameter for this question being the schedule date, `sd/SCHEDULE_DATE`.

* When the user passes in a date of the incorrect format, it shows a `Date field must be given in the format yyyy-MM-dd.` error message.
* However, when the user passes in an invalid date in the correct format, it shows the same error message.

In this case, could I confirm we are allowed to update the error message since the error message is incorrect? And if we were to update the error message, it should follow the `widening the scope` guideline (e.g. `Date field must be given in the format yyyy-MM-dd and must be a valid date`)

One of our PE-D testers found an [issue](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/issues/218) with our error messages where
* If both `OLD_TAG` and `NEW_TAG` are empty strings (or just whitespaces), then a `Tags should be alphanumeric` error message is shown
* If both `OLD_TAG` is an empty string (or just whitespaces) but `NEW_TAG` is valid, then a `Tag is not found` error message is shown

We agree that the error messages should be consistent. Are we allowed to change the error message in both cases to be `Tags should be alphanumeric and not empty`? We are unsure about how to change the error message without violating the feature freeze (under tweaking UI text, widening the scope of the error message).

If the jar file name does not match the Quick Start section in UG, does it mean that if the user has no idea what `java -jar xxx.jar` means (i.e. no idea that he should change the name of the jar file in the command) cannot use the app at all? Can it be a high severity bug?

Currently when the user adds a person with company "CompanyA", the UI displays "companyA", which is not intended. We believe that this is a UI bug as incorrect data is being displayed and since we do not plan to change the case sensitivity of the company field, are we allowed to fix this during the feature freeze?

@damithc Hi Prof, I have a follow-up question on this matter to make sure our team does not violate the feature freeze.

Currently, we are converting the company input by user to lower case even before assigning it to the instance variable

<img width="875" alt="Company" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccc719ac-d852-4234-a1cc-c05d3c9dc1ee">

In order to ensure that we display the correct text in the UI, we will not use the `normalizeCompanyname()` function in the constructor. However to maintain the definition of a duplicate supplier, we intend to modify the `equals()` function to normalise the company name before we check for equality.

<img width="410" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-10 at 2 13 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38fe4671-9c5e-46ae-a516-4f2ff3c6fe08">


Will this be allowed?

Regarding this section where it states "Multiple buggy behaviors that are actually caused by the same defect and cannot be fixed independently (i.e., fixing one fixes the others automatically)." can I take this to mean that if the same line of code is responsible for the bug only then it would be considered duplicate issue? Otherwise if it is code in 2 separate locations then it would not be a duplicate.

An example would be like if for 2 commands they have an error with parsing a certain command. Would reporting the bug as 2 separate issues for each command be valid since I am assuming that the issue is due to errors in different parts of code?

**2. :fas-info-circle: IP Grading**
</div>

I was hoping someone could clarify whether based on these comments I received for my IP, would I be likely to fail the grading for the IP. The feedback stated (Copied Below) that I was at risk of failing criteria for [tests, exceptions] however looking through the comments they don't exactly seem to be saying anything about this. I appreciate the feedback but unsure if it is relevant if considering only the criteria set by the 2103 team. 

GUI -- Unable to view full list; only able to see first task, and adding an event cuts off the response text. Window unable to expand as well (wanted to view the cut-off text and tried expanding but could not). "Bye" command also does nothing. Chat can be continued after issuing that command.

Abstraction -- Files like Parser.java have long methods that include processes that can be done by a helper function. For example, in parseFile, after reading individual files, the processing (parseFileTodo, parseFileDeadline, parseFileEvent) could be done in another method like processLine. Likewise, the parseFileTodo, parseFileDeadline, parseFileEvent have multiple repeated code, within each function and between the 3 functions as well. For example, in parseFileTodo

if (isDone) ``{``
    ToDos newToDo = new ToDos(input[2]);
    newToDo.markAsDone();
    taskList.addTask(newToDo);
``}`` else ``{``
    ToDos newToDo = new ToDos(input[2]);
    taskList.addTask(newToDo);
``}``

everything but markAsDone is repeated. In the other two methods, retrieving the date is repeated.

Tests -- The tests written are all stored in one file (PapaguTest.java) even though it tests listing (which should be UiTest.java) and adding an event (which should be EventTest.java). Furthermore, the tests seem to rely on the save file being of a certain state already when you list it as the test method seems to import the save file (Papagu papagu = new Papagu("src/main/java/Data/tasks.txt");)and then listing it without adding any tasks to the list.  

Neatness -- Lots of unnecessary whitespacing (multiple 1 line whitespaces between chunks of code that does not seem to require whitespacing separation, like in Parser.java).

Comments -- JavaDoc seems extremely minimal, with some not explaining what the param(s) and return value are. E.g. Parser::parseFileTodo: 

/**
 * Parses the file for ToDos
 * @param input
 * @param isDone
 * @param taskList
 */

I was unsure what input and taskList were until I found the method calling this method and had to read each line code.

Overall, working product (GUI) looks to attain the minimal expectations while lacking in certain minimal UI features like the task list being cut off when requested. Codebase looks hastily done, though.

Does an object's name in an object diagram have any specific rules behind it?

For part b, I would assume the heading field of the Handout is meant to uniquely identify it, kind of like a name. so would it be okay to have "Intro" as the name of the object, and then omit it from the attributes portion?

Or does it strictly follow the name of the variable the object is associated with?
i.e. if i had `Handout h = new Handout(...)` the object name would then be h?

Thanks for the quick response prof! So if a bug is considered as `NotInScope`, would its severity would still be taken into account? For example, a `severity.Medium` `NotInScopeBug` scores more marks than a `severity.Low` `NotInScopeBug`.

Hi Prof,

As shown in the screenshot below, certain content that was originally hidden behind a drop down is not shown in the Exam-reference.pdf. May I check if this was intended, or are we supposed to view these contents?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Overlap of bugs that is addressed in planned enhancements**
</div>


Hi Prof,

In our planned enhancement, to address Bug A, we decided to have an enhancement that removes the use of pop-up windows. We then receive a Bug B, which the underlying cause is the use of pop-up windows. Since our planned enhancement already mentioned that we are not using pop-up windows, is Bug B still valid?

Thank you!

Normally I would not recommend trying to fix it since it is pushed upstream. (Other people might be working on it)
But since this repo is just for you. 
1. Reset `branch-A-CodeQuality`'s `HEAD` by 1 (Undo merge of `master`)
2. Reset `master`'s `HEAD` by 2 (Undo merge of `branch-A-CodeQuality` and `branch-A-Assertions` into `master`)
3. Rebase `branch-A-Assertions` to the commit with tag `A-Checkstyle` (Makes the 2 branches parallel)
4. Merge the 2 branches into `master` 
5. Force push

Hello, for the issues I reported and demonstrated with a video, the video does not appear embedded in the github issues although it is clearly refelcted in the CATcher issue reporter, so I am worried that this might affect the clarity of my bug report and that it will be construed as less effective by the team. May I edit the github issue directly to include the video? Thanks!

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡 Branching: Ensure a merge commit is always created without fast-forwarding on mac**
</div>

Tip for macOS users:

I initially encountered an issue when trying to merge branch-Level-7 into master on my mac. The option to merge without fast-forwarding didn’t appear in the popup. After some some time I eventually discovered there's a default setting in Sourcetree that ensures all merges create a merge commit, preventing fast-forward merges.

To enable this setting:

1. Go to Sourcetree settings by using the shortcut (Command ,) or by selecting Sourcetree > Settings from the top menu bar

2. Navigate to the Git section

3. Tick the box "Do not fast-forward when merging, always create commit."

Ah my bad, I think it's because I removed the video link text from the issue since I only wanted the video itself to be shown without the video:..... text. I have responded to the team's issue with the video and it previews fine. I don't think it's an issue anymore. Thanks for your time and speedy responses Prof!

Hi Prof, we would like to clarify if the following changes would violate the feature freeze:

For one command, our error message is "Person has already been added", but should be "Contact has already been added", because our app uses the word "contact" rather than "person", making "person" an incorrect word. Would this be allowed? (as the initial error message is incorrect)

For another command, our intended behaviour was for success on inputting "Y", "y", "Yes" or "yes". Our current message is incorrect as it only lists "Y/Yes". We intend to update it to include the options "y" and "yes". Could I clarify if this is allowed? (as it is widening the scope)

@damithc Thank you Prof for your reply! For the first one, it is in the context of when a user edits a contact to have the same phone number as an existing contact. Would it thus be okay to change "Person" to "Phone number"? Question 6 of the FAQs regarding feature freeze mentions that it is okay to change outdated AB3 terms such as "person", would this fall under that category?

**2. :fas-info-circle: get file contents to persist between runs**
</div>

hi everyone, im having trouble with level 7, more specifically "Load the data from the hard disk when the chatbot starts up." because whatever i write to the file doesn't persist when i run the program again. i'm using java.io.FileWriter to read and write to files:

 ```
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("data/sigma.txt");
        try ``{``
            File file = new File("data/sigma.txt");
            if (file.createNewFile()) ``{``
                System.out.println("New file created: " + file.getName());
            ``}`` else ``{``
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
                // open the file
                for (String line: Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/sigma.txt"))) ``{``
                    System.out.println(line + "\n");
                ``}``
            ``}``
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            System.out.println("error occurred creating file");
        ``}``

// handle todo task
// ...
 items.add(task);
 try ``{``
    writer.write(task + "\n");
    writer.flush(); 
``}`` catch (IOException exception) ``{``
     System.err.println("an error occurred writing to file" + exception.getMessage());
``}``

// close program
            if (userInput.contains("bye")) ``{``
                System.out.println("bye");
                writer.flush();
                writer.close();
                break;
            ``}``
```

it always prints out "File already exists" but the file will be empty on every run. anyone has any luck trying to get the contents to persist? or should i use a different class to write to files

sorry for terrible formatting

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Failing automated testing because of trailing whitespaces. (MacOS)**
</div>

When comparing ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT I realised I was failing the test because my ACTUAL.TXT file had whitespaces at the end of some lines specifically at lines where the script writes inputs. 

To fix this I added the following lines of code in the `runtest.sh` file after both text files were converted to UNIX:
```
# trim trailing whitespace
sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]*$//' ACTUAL.TXT
sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]*$//' EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT
```
These commands search for any whitespaces at the end of both text files and removes them. 

I'm not sure how to do the same on Windows or if this is common practise at all so maybe someone else can chime in below.

I just copy pasted the Actual.txt file into the Expected.txt file from my clipboard the first time I ran the script like the tutorial suggested. Maybe the issue inherently is with the way I print my particular strings because when I copied it over, some of the white spaces did not transfer over properly and even when I manually edited them in, after saving the file, they would just disappear. 

What would then be a better practise in the future for this particular case?

Did you do a similar thing as me to fix this or did you do something else that didn't involve modifying the test script?

From my understanding, it seems that the above is intentional due to the 8 spaces required for wrapped lines: 

> Indentation for wrapped lines should be 8 spaces (i.e. twice the normal indentation of 4 spaces) more than the parent line.

However, I do agree that in the case of method chaining, it does look cleaner if the methods were aligned. I don't know if we're allowed to make suggestions to the coding style, though.

Hi, 2 possibly minor issues were found.
Firstly, doing archive with extra text works instead of notifying the user of an errant command. If this is a feature, then feel free to ignore it:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdaa46ff-c51f-4ee5-becc-2f684b5e95d4)

Secondly, when I archive my task list, proceed to add further tasks and archive again, it overwrites the previously archived tasks. 2 ways to fix this would be to either changing from writing to appending when you save to archive.txt, or a while loop to increment the archive(n).txt for each new archived file.

I got the following error when running your code. Might have to do with your build.gradle file, if you're using a Mac (i'm a Windows user)

Hi there. I have roughly tested your program on my system (Linux) and it works just fine. 
I might be nitpicking abit but I wish I can see all my 11 tasks i have when using the `list` command.

**1. :fas-info-circle: How do I allow multiple lines of text input for runtest.bat?**

https://github.com/lm-44/ip/blob/master/text-ui-test/input.txt

However, runtest.bat only outputs the result for the 1st command "todo test" as seen in ACTUAL.TXT below, and not the second line. e.g.
```

        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1660)

> The reason this happens is because you keep creating a new instance of the scanner every time the loop repeats.
> 
> When the first instance of the scanner is created, it takes in an input. When ran without a script, this is the user keyboard input. When ran with a script, this is the input text file provided.
> 
> Thus on every loop iteration, a new instance of the scanner means that the previous input stream gets reset and it awaits for new user/ file input. Since there is no other file supplied, you get the error that you see, "Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found". The program then terminates and gives you the mismatch between your expected and actual files.
> 
> To resolve this, you can create your scanner instance outside of the while loop.

Hi, I also encountered a similar issue. However, my test cases were not able to be run even through the terminal. I fixed it by using gradle to clean the previous build, and building it again.

As stated by the error, I believe gradle was unable to find the test cases. When I only ran the specific test case, ToDoTest in this case, which is under the Tasks package, the following error pops up.
```
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> No tests found for given includes: [tasks.ToDoTest](--tests filter)

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
```
I then ran it using the following gradle test command
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a025bd5-0fca-49c4-8836-ac3af6ed8b89)

This gave me the following error:
```
> Task :compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :processTestResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :testClasses UP-TO-DATE
> Task :test FAILED
CookTest > dummyTest() PASSED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> There were failing tests. See the report at: file:///C:/Users/lm-44/Downloads/ip/build/reports/tests/test/index.html
* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.

> Run with --scan to get full insights.
* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org
BUILD FAILED in 733ms
3 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 2 up-to-date
```

Opening the report allowed me to see this page, which I then clicked on the failed test.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131ec10a-1831-4841-a652-b5fb76de6f24)

One of the lines informed me that gradle was expecting my test to be under the "Tasks" folder instead of "tasks" folder.
```
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: tasks/ToDoTest (wrong name: Tasks/ToDoTest)
```
This was likely because I renamed my "Tasks" package to "tasks" instead to follow package name conventions. Having already built the project before this change, I am guessing that gradle was expecting a different name based on the built project, which led to the error.

If rebuilding your project doesn't fix your error, maybe your report may tell you more to help fix it.

@jevan13  Is this your second time running the tests? If I am right gradle caches the build if you have passed the test successfully once, which would show it as skipped in IntelliJ.

You can use the cli gradlew to force the test, see whether it works:
`./gradlew test --rerun-tasks` 

alternatively modify some bits of your code and rerun the test in IntelliJ

@jevan13 This is what I got after running `./gradlew test --rerun-tasks` on your code (after uncommenting `testLogging` in your `build.gradle` - on branch **Forum(A-JUnit)** )

The test is ran but somehow is skipped, the weirdest part is when I copied your test code and run it on my own ip it's somehow working?

I see that some of your commit messages do not follow what’s in the guide, so I presume that’s not the problem. Rather I infer that the problem lies in the structure of the branch. Perhaps you could try using Sourcetree to visualise the structure and confirm that this is just how the branch structure looks like in your repository? Alternatively, a third option, you can also visualise the git branches on the CLI via `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`. I hope this helps!

I would like to share my thoughts as well. My opinion is to make things that are supposed to _always_ be immutable, immutable and things that are not immutable not immutable. Things should not be immutable by default unless enforced by the programming language (e.g. you are using a functional programming language).

When you create a class that is final, it should be a _final_ commitment. Every other piece of code that will interact with your class will try to make a copy just to make modifications. Some pieces of concurrent code may also assume that it will never change and treat it as safe for [repeatable reads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93write_conflict).

When a new requirement comes and forces us to change our class to not be final, then we are breaking all these assumptions we initially had. We may have to analyse every usage, which is very time consuming.

That being said:
- The stakes are much lower for `private` and unexposed (i.e. no getters) fields since it is only visible to the current class. So don't worry so much about it
- I don't see much difference in making a class `final`...but these people seem to have quite a bit to say: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218744/good-reasons-to-prohibit-inheritance-in-java

---

On a separate note,

> I think for the future when we add more stuff to the code, if we make it immutable its gonna take a really long time to load it. So I personally jsut did a mutable one

There is a way to make immutable objects "faster" but at the cost of code complexity (since Java does not support it natively). Can take a look at [persistent data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure). Clojure is an example of a language that supports it natively.

I think that enums offer two main possible benefits:
1. Slight speed increase (as we will learn/have learned in CS2100)
2. Type checking for constants

I agree with @cth06-Github that currently there is no need to use enums for the commands. Currently, there is only one usage of such an enum. For example, if we had an enum like WinstonJin has mentioned:

```java
enum Commands ``{``
    TODO("todo"),
    DEADLINE("deadline"),
    // ...
``}``
```

The rest of our codebase will only use this enum once: when we are parsing the first word from the user's input and checking what to do:
```java
switch (Commands.valueOf(input)) ``{``
    case Commands.TODO:
        // run todo
        break;
    // ...
``}``
```

Since it is only used once, there is no point in separating it into another enum. We should make an enum only if there is somewhere else in our code where we need to use the `Commands` enum. This way, we can leverage on the type checking the compiler does to ensure both values are the same.

**1. :fas-info-circle: iP tag and commit enquiries**
</div>



It's stated "git tag the commit with the exact increment ID e.g., Level-2, A-TextUiTesting" in the CS2103/T site but I have 2 questions about this. 

1.) Is omitting the spaces alright as it seems Sourcetree doesn't allow for spaces in tag name? 
2.) When I try to assign 2 commits to a tag of similar name, Sourcetree seems to not permit this (prompts me to transfer the tag to the other commit). What if I have several commits which relate to the same incrementID/stage? E.g. Level-0.Rename,Greet,Exit -&gt; Would Level-**0.1**.Rename,Greet,Exit suffice if there was a 2nd commit working on this same stage?

@somethingfishyfishy I could be wrong but my understanding of enums is that while they are used for discrete and finite values, the range should be relatively small(e.g. days of the week) as well else one has to define an enumerated name for every integer(0-10000) which isn't very practical.

Hi Prof,

We have received more bug reports on the app than the standard allocation ( 5 x 7 = 35 bugs) --> meaning more testers were allocated to our app.

My Team would like to clarify if this could be taken into consideration during grading? Despite having more testers and henceforth a higher number of bug defense reports to prepare, we still face the same time constraints for defence as other teams.

We would appreciate your understanding of this situation.

1. You can right click the commit you reverted (with the commit details Revert "A-TextUiTesting & Removed Indentations") 
2. **Click on the same option "Reverse commit..."**. 
3. You will be able to get back to the original state right before you clicked the reverse commit button.

Agreeing with the points above, it would be good practice to include the default case to handle values (e.g by throwing an exception) that are not explicitly handled by the cases.

I guess the difference here is that in the first code block, the `Name` objects (which are a friend of a friend) are not declared as an input to the method `foo`, meaning they are "strangers". In the second code block, technically the `Name` objects are direct parameters to `goo`, thus are not considered strangers.

My take would be that despite this technicality, the idea of LoD is still violated because the internal structure of Person is still traversed.

Hello, I ran your jar file on my mac and everything looks good, just have a few comments:

-  Maybe could have a more useful message when the list is empty so that it doesn't seem like the app is malfunctioning?
- I think your current code dumps the whole data file when 1 input is faulty instead of just discarding that particular data input, not sure if its your intended behaviour
- Can consider trimming whitespaces from inputs also so that people cannot insert empty descriptions for the tasks
- Maybe can make find non caps-sensitive so that "read" and "Read" are basically the same word 

Other that that, I think its great!

**1. :fas-info-circle: PE Severity level of bug based on consequences**
</div>

Hi Prof, I had a question relating to a severity level of a bug. Say for example you discovered a bug and you reported it as `medium`. However, after the PE, you realized that the bug, if you followed the steps to reproduce, will cause the applications memory to be lost upon restart, which seems like a bug with high severity.

In this case, although you did not state the memory lost as the issue, should you still classify it as a high severity?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0473b4f-daba-4392-9a5b-fc77b87c9ef1)

Scenario:
After some online checking, I learnt its difficult for me to test this certain UI related class (CommandBox) unless I learn how use mockito, it seems. Probably, I can still test some underlying logic but I won't hit the 77% required by codecov.

And I'm pretty sure I'm unable to finish implementing this Test Class by v1.4 deadline (or that I know how to make test cases :( in this case) because unlike AddCommandTest classes, there is almost no reference or guidance on how to create test cases for this class...

Can I bypass codecov test coverage and merge the PR first? Will I be deducted marks if so? (or if I don't ever address the lack of code coverage in this class at all in the upcoming versions)

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question on how to integrate the GUI and CLI together for the iP**
</div>

Context:
My iP now supports operations from both the CLI and a GUI. Also, when I type the "bye" command in my CLI, while terminating the CLI, I can close the GUI window automatically as well. To implement both CLI and GUI simultaneously, I utilized The Java Thread class to create new threads.

Problem:
However, I am unable to do the same the other way around. When I close my GUI, I am unable to terminate the CLI automatically. I have a hunch that the thread running the GUI (thread 1) is unable to close the thread running the CLI (thread 2) as thread 2 has an active scanner that is actively waiting for a new line. I have tried ways to interrupt the scanner but I am still unable to solve the issue.

Looking for some advice on how to solve the problem of automatically terminating the CLI when closing the GUI window. Thank you for reading.

Hi prof,

Thank you for your quick response.

My rationale is more about learning and exploring the possibility of implementing both UIs, rather than practical reasons.

At the moment, the user cannot choose between the UIs, but I believe I can implement this functionality with relative ease.

Hi prof,

In (a), for the missing dependency between handout and section, to represent the dependency whereby the method capacity inside Section class references Handout class in its parameters, is it correct to show a dotted arrow pointing from 
Section class to Handout class or should we use a solid line arrow.

Hi, this is a late update but to whomever that is still interested in this issue, I realised the problem causing the CI page to hang was the usage of automated JavaFX testing in my JUnit tests. 
If I am not mistaken, there are restrictions to running some JavaFX tests in the ubuntu/Linux environments and the CI process hangs as the tests are not being ran/testing environment not set up properly.

My team and I decided on splitting the workload for week 8 tP by components as there is much to change regarding the removal/addition of new fields and functions to each component of the tP since this is our first time actually working on the tP. 

However, after updating the "model" component of the tP, we realised that sending a PR to the team repo would mean that the PR would fail the test cases (since it is the updated version with new fields & functions and different argument orders for the already existing functions). 

Since we were taught to not merge PRs that fail test cases, what are the potential work arounds for this? Should one person edit all files required to remove/update all the new and unused classes and fields?

Hi, I had a similar issue whereby my application was running in the IDE but the jar was not. It turned out that there was a capital letter causing in my path name causing it to be incorrect. So maybe just make sure all your file paths are exactly word for word correct. If I'm not wrong the ...20 more at the end of the error message in the terminal might help you out and tell you exactly where the error is. So you could try directing the error message into a text file and see if it gives you more details.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Forking Workflow for v1.2**
</div>

Hello Professors,

I would like to seek clarification regarding the forking workflow for our project in v1.2.

Our team has been divided into two sub-teams, one focusing on the UI and the other on the logic. To prevent potential conflicts, we are considering creating two separate branches from the master branch in our upstream repository—one for the UI team and another for the logic team. Each sub-team would then make their pull requests to their respective branches. This would allow us to isolate changes in each domain, and the master branch would remain untouched until we are ready to merge the two branches at the end of the cycle.

I wanted to confirm if this approach is allowed or recommended for our project as I have yet to see anything relating to branching from the upstream repo.

Thank you for your guidance!

Additionally it is worth noting that according to the text book 

> No more than one alternative partitions be executed in an alt frame. That is, it is acceptable for none of the alternative partitions to be executed but it is not acceptable for multiple partitions to be executed.

The main point being it is possible that none of the alternate paths are executed. I did not notice this at first while answering this question and thought exactly 1 path needs to be executed which would make things a lot more complicated.

As I understand from your user guide, 'archive' command will only archive completed task (which I interpret as "marked" task), however when I type archive, all tasks are gone regardless of their marking status

**1. :fas-info-circle: Can this be considered a bug?**
</div>


Hi, our app allows special characters (`'`, `-`, `/`) in names when using the add command. However, we encountered a bug with the find command, which rejects inputs containing these valid special characters due to outdated validation regex. 

For example, "M'Lynn" is accepted by add but triggers an "invalid name" error in `find M'Lynn`. Would this be classified as a "Rejecting valid input" bug that can be fixed in v1.6?

Hi Prof, thanks for the reply.

> Can you elaborate what's 'incorrect'?

By updating the validation regex for the find command to accept valid inputs, it will allow special characters (`'`, `-`, `/`) and up to 255 characters (since our app accepts names of up to 255 characters). However, the current invalid input message states "Please make sure the name is between 1-100 characters and only contains alphabets and spaces." This information is incorrect because we actually allow certain special characters and up to 255 characters.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b851d578-e40f-433d-9f9b-da5a176edb96)

Hence we would like to update the message to: "Please make sure the name is between 1-255 characters and only contains alphabets, spaces, and these special characters (excluding the parentheses): (- / ')."

Would this be permissible?

I think it's because your current branch is set to track origin/main, but origin/main has been removed or is no longer available on the remote.
Hence, if you would like to reset the tracking, git is suggesting you to 'git branch --unset-upstream'.

One hint is to check the branches that exist on the remote first:
'
git branch -r
'

Are we allowed to change it such that the user has to type in **add &lt;Item name>** for it to be added into the list, since the functionality is the same but the method of adding is different.

I have completed the code for adding the remark command for the tp on my side, and made sure that all the test cases can be passed. However, I keep encountering build errors (the ones for macOS and windows) and I am not sure what I am supposed to do. I double checked to make sure I am using the Zulu java 17 version. 

My development environment is IntelliJ and im using a Mac. I have figured out the build(ubuntu) but not the other two.

Great job in designing the GUI, with circular pictures of the faces. For duplicate detection, I would like to ask if its the intended feature to detect duplicates across tasks (for example, a todo and event with the same description is considered a duplicate). I thought the duplicate detection applied for duplicates within the same category of tasks (e.g. 2 todos with the same description is not allowed but a todo and an event with the same description is allowed as its under different categories)

Hi!

Which branch was the deleted commit on? Was the commit pushed before you deleted it? If it was, then there's a chance you could retrieve it. I'm trying to see from your repo but I'm not sure haha.... 

If the commits were local and not pushed, I believe there is a chance that your IDE might have shelved them...

@RezwanAhmed123 I think your approach generally makes sense but in my opinion your UI class should still include your text input. This is because UI involves both input and output from/to users. 

Likewise, I used enums and allowed the Command class to have an `execute` method

@somethingfishyfishy I think another concern would be performance and memory. Creating an enumeration with 10001 values (0 to 10000) would be extremely inefficient in terms of both memory usage and performance as compared as an if statement that checks if value between 0 and 10000. The extra memory is also not needed because each value from 0 to 10000 serves no other meaning besides representing the integer value, whilst enumeration is best used when each value has a distinct semantic meaning.

From what I can tell, every functionality works as intended. I like the unique UI and animation playing in the background, and automatic resizing also works, although can consider locking resizing of height due to the white bar. Maybe consider adding some way a user can quit the system other than outright closing the window with x button, but overall very impressive and good work. 👍

From what I understand, there should only be a main branch in the main repo. 

1. But in the absence of other branches, all individual forks will need to PR into the main branch. Does this mean a team member must fully develop a feature by himself instead of working on modules (UI, Model etc.)? I ask this because if I was only changing the Model code, the app would be temporarily broken until another team member changes the relevant Command and UI code.

Would like to ask if functionally are there any differences in the first and second picture?

**1. :fas-info-circle: GUI works when using ./gradlew run but not using IntelliJs play button**
</div>

Hi, I was able to set up my GUI a few days ago and run it just fine on IntelliJ.

However, I did some commits which added JavaDocs to my codebase and now it doesn't work when I run my Main class on IntelliJ. It only works I do ./gradlew run on the terminal. 

I have reverted my local copy to the commit in which it was previously working before, and I am still encountering the same issue. I'm puzzled because I did not edit anything in my codebase and my dependencies are the same, so I can't understand why it gives me the error that my JavaFX components are missing since the code is exactly the same and no dependencies have been changed.

Below is an attached screenshot of running my Main class with --stacktrace.

Hi I faced this issue too but it works with this configuration

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd33fed6-137a-4a5a-9c38-eaeb3bdea553)

1. Under project structure -&gt; SDK, I chose the Zulu 17 version instead of OpenJDK 17. Previously I was using OpenJDK 17 also. Not super sure why it works but might be that OpenJDK 17 doesn't have JavaFX
2. If you want to use OpenJDK 17 version, go to Run -&gt; Edit Configurations  -&gt; Modify Options -&gt; Add VM options. Then add '--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics' but change /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib to the path of where your JavaFX SDK libraries are located in your computer. Again not super sure why this works but if its because OpenJDK 17 doesn't have JavaFX, then this probably just specifies it.

I believe you're right that related classes should be grouped into the same package. In your case, if you have an abstract class and three classes that extend it, it indeed does makes sense to bundle them together in one package since they share a common purpose or functionality. Creating a separate "exceptions" package for your exception classes is also another good way to organise your code.


> following the convention that files in the same package have to be of the same type

Regarding the above, I believe the convention that files in the same package have to be of the same "type" is more about maintaining logical cohesion rather than enforcing a strict rule so I would think that both your suggested ways of packaging your files would be acceptable so long as it makes logical sense.

For your 2nd question, I don't think every file needs to be in a package, but it's generally good practice to place all your classes, including your main executable (e.g. "Duke"), in packages to avoid naming conflicts and to better organize your code.

Regarding the error you got, yes I believe you are right that the error you're seeing is related to the change in the directory structure.. It seems like it happened because the references to your main class in other files (like `EXPECTED.TXT`, `README.md`, `runtest.bat`) would be outdated after moving it and need to be updated to reflect the new package structure. For example, if your class was previously referenced as `DGPT`, it would now need to be referenced as `main.DGPT` (if you put it in a package named `main`).

Hey, downloaded your chatbot on a windows system. Functions work great!

You can make the bye command exit the program after a duration by importing some javaFX libraries. It currently only plays the bye message.

Hi there, I used a Mac to test out your JAR file. Your README is informative and you went through the various functions. Just a little format issue for the tagging. As seen in the screenshot, I was able to tag without the # and it looked like i just added onto the previous tag. Not sure if this is something you may want to refine but overall I think the bot is working and nice!!

As our delete command allows multiple indices to be specified, there was a bug resulting from the same index being used multiple times in the command. As such, we added a check for this and changed the command usage message accordingly as shown in the image below.

Would this be considered widening the scope of an error message, and thus be allowed, as the command usage message implicitly tells the user what the error might be caused by?

Hi prof, 

I have a follow-up question on grading.
For milestone v1.2, we are expected to merge some code.
Is it ok to merge to a feature branch instead of the master branch in v1.2 as long as we merge the feature branch in v1.3?
Or will we be penalised because the grading script does not recognise other branches?

Thank you!

I think you need the isComplete method is for other class to check the status of current class and change the status of current class.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Reported a bug as functionality bug, but the developers claim its a documentation bug**
</div>

I reported bugs as functionality bug since it does not match what is stated in the User Guide.
However, the developer's response for most of them is that the User Guide is wrong and the behaviour of the app is the intended one, hence it is a bug with the User Guide instead, constituting a documentation bug.

Since I am a tester and I cannot know what is intended if their app functionality differs from the documentation, do I have to accept that the bugs are indeed documentation bugs?

Hi, I tested it briefly on windows and all the basic features work fine.

Data saving and loading works and creating tasks works.
Only minor bug I encountered is using 'bye' command does not seem to do anything. You can interact with the chatbot perfectly fine after giving the 'bye' command.

i used the registered Github for the latter. Looking at the grading rubrics I am unsure if the amount of code written attributed to the wrong account will affect my grade since the tp expectation expects to hit a certain implementation bar. Will the changes made to the code under the wrong still be considered for tp implementation effort

Hi, I'm on windows and it runs fine for me. Here are some bugs that i think can be improved relatively quickly:

- Calling delete on outOfBound Indexes (such as `delete -5`) will cause error messages to show on the terminal but nothing is shown on the GUI itself. 

- As shown in the image of the user guide, I think there is a typo here as it should be `t` to add ToDos instead of `d`.

I realise that the code works when I run the "run" task through the CLI, however it does not seem to be able to work by running the "run" task through the GUI. The code can be found in the branch-A-Gradle branch in my fork. Nontheless, since my code works through the CLI, and I am not editing my code using IntelliJ IDE, I will be closing the issue and sticking to the CLI to run gradle tasks. Thank you all for your help!

Thank you @damithc and @yadobler. I realised that the `master` branch indeed progressed after I started on the PR branch which may have affected the test cases as mentioned by the FAQ.

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡 Custom/External Fonts in JavaFX via CSS**
</div>

Was pretty frustrating to figure out, with ChatGPT + Internet searches giving confusing contradicting info, so here's what worked for me if anyone wants to know:

---

### 1. Get your font files

Generally of the filetypes `.otf` or `.ttf`. Create a new folder `fonts` in your `src/main/resources` directory. Place the files there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7a9008-046a-409d-a3a1-faab1de60ddb)

### 2. Load fonts

In your `Main` class, or whatever extends `Application` and is where your GUI runs from, import

```java
import javafx.scene.text.Font;
```

And add the following in the constructor:

```java
Font.loadFont(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/fonts/<font-filename>"), v);
```

- Replace `<font-filename>` with the filename of the font you want to use, e.g. `comic.ttf` that is present in `resources/fonts`. 
- `v` is the default font size.

### 3. Add fonts to CSS

Whenever you specify a font in CSS, simply replace that string with the name of the font you have loaded. 
```css
.button ``{``
    ...
    -fx-font: bold 16px "Comic Sans MS";
    ...
``}``

.text-field ``{``
    ...
    -fx-font-family: "Montserrat SemiBold";
    ...
``}``
```

#### Note:

You might want to check the exact name of the font, since it can be different from the filename of that font. Make sure in the CSS sheet you use the **actual name** (e.g. `Montserrat SemiBold` or `Comic Sans MS`) and not the **filename** (`Montserrat-SemiBold` or `comic`).

You can obtain the names by:

```java
Font font1 = Font.loadFont(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf"), 18); // load font from file
font1.getName(); // gets you name of the font
```

### Voila!

You can now show off to ~~the world~~ your teammates your excellent taste in font choice.

@damithc Hi prof, can I clarify if the full version of Adobe Acrobat is allowed, or specifically just Adobe Acrobat **Reader**. I have an Adobe CC subscription (which includes Acrobat) so running the installer for Acrobat Reader just recognises the full version of Acrobat as already installed, and doesn't install Acrobat Reader separately.

Just to check, is the `bye` command supposed to do anything? When I tried it, it showed the exit message but didn't automatically exit the application. Is closing the application window with X the only way to exit the application?

Otherwise, all other features work as intended. Great job with the UI as well! :)

Hi, it may seem that your output from the print is different compared to the expected output given by you, likely due to a missing newline at the end (remember that println will always end with a newline, however the expected test result is missing a final newline at the very end).

This is also evident from your output given:

>  3.[T][ ] read book> but was: &lt; Here are the tasks in your list that match book:

As you can see the ">" is on the same line as the output (whereas there is a blank line between the actual output and the final line, "Process...")

> 3.[T][ ] read book
> 
> Process finished with exit code -1

Do try this out and see if it works! Hope this helps!

Just to add on (for those not keen on using SDKMAN), you have to double check that you are downloading the FX variant under "Java Package" (especially if you are downloading manually)

<img width="209" alt="Screenshot 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc829d1-8fc4-4d76-97e7-55905526068f"><br/>

Alternatively, the shortcut link is also given on the instructions page:

<img width="956" alt="Screenshot 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c28e6761-1552-4883-8beb-d28e291c1813"><br/>

You may then just download the `.dmg` installer file and install right away, and this will set the default version of Java on your system to be Java 17 JDK+FX. Be sure to also choose the correct version for your platform (Intel macs: x86 64-bit, Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3: ARM 64-bit) 

Hope this helps!

In my team's TP project, some of the commands include a description field (d/) that accepts free text.

Is this behaviour considered a functionality bug, and is additional handling recommended to avoid potential confusion for users? Or can it be considered as intended functionality? Thanks!

I ran your jar file on macOS Ventura 13.5.2 and didn't encounter any errors. 
I played around a little bit and didn't encounter any crashes but here are some minor things you might want to take note of:

- error message formatting starts with `error: error: ` not sure if this is intended?

- Trying to delete a bad task number results in `an unexpected error occurred` but `task index out of range` may be a more useful error message

- input: `event NAME /to TODATE /from FROMDATE`
output: `... (from: TODATE to: FROMDATE)` which flips the two dates

<img width="403" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 2 54 44 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a9bd257-4f42-47e5-b743-ad05df4bbe24">


otherwise the program looks great :)

My teammates @Jasperabez @hanscau and @C5hives had created (and merged) PRs during the v1.4 milestone, but the PRs appear to have gone undetected.
As such, their progress dashboards mark v1.4 PRs as incomplete.

Is this an error with the grading scripts, or did we miss something that caused the PRs to be considered invalid? Thanks for the assistance!

#As you start adding features to your project iteratively, you'll need a way to detect if the new code breaks the existing code. Next, let's learn a rather simple way to do that using a certain type of testing (we'll be learning more sophisticated methods in later weeks).

This also means we are **not** switching focus from the implementation aspect to the testing aspect of SE.

I think `Ui` is for receiving input while `Parser` is for processing the input. For example, `Ui` might have a `readLine` method to receive input from the user, but it will pass the raw input to `Parser` to make sense of the input.

For me, my `Parser` class has a static method to parse the description of a task, and a static method to parse the slash arguments for a task. So, I would do something like this:
```
String description = Parser.parseDescription(input);
Map<String, String> arguments = Parser.parseArguments(input);
```
This extracts the values I need from the input line, and then I can do something else with those values.

Hi, if you want to disable Checkstyle checks, you can use build and exclude the Checkstyle tasks. Thus, you can try '''- name: Build with Gradle with Gradle run: ./gradlew build -x checkstyleMain -x checkstyleTest ''' -x checkstyleMain and -x checkstyleTest are used to exclude the Checkstyle tasks. These tasks might be named differently depending on your configuration, but checkstyleMain and checkstyleTest are the standard names for Checkstyle tasks in many setups. To verify task names, you can also run the following command locally to list all available tasks and their names: '''./gradlew tasks --all'''

I played around with SceneBuilder and managed to fix the same problem with my GUI, changing the preferred height of the HBox and Label to use computed size and the HGrow of the Label to "ALWAYS" seemed to fix it for me. I think the max height for both the HBox and Label need to be max value as well.

Hi, ran your jar file on my mac and everything looks good, just some small comments:
- Perhaps a help message could be included to list all possible commands.
- The positioning of text changes if the message is too long.
- There is an unknown error when the event /to date is after the /from date, perhaps an error message like "to date must be after from date" would be better?

Good job!

I think the problem might be due to you connecting to your GitHub repo via the **HTTPS url** instead of the **SSH url**.
If the remote of your local repo is named **origin**, you can use the following command in your CLI to change the url of your remote to a new one. e.g the new url is **new.link/here**

`git remote set-url origin new.link/here`

The FAQs section under Wk 13's Project section may be helpful. Particularly, Q1 and Q2.

https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week13/project.html#1-fix-pe-d-bugs

Tldr, you just need to see if the actual behavior differs from the behavior advertised in your user guide. If it differs, you could update the user guide as though it is a documentation bug. (Which is allowed)

Alternatively, if your team believes it is more appropriate to sort it alphabetically instead of by ascii value, you could add this feature fix as an item in the Planned enhancements DG section. Then, if the feature flaw were to be reported during the actual PE, you can successfully argue that it is 'not in scope'.

**Note to us all: If we report any feature flaws that are 'not in scope' (according to DG's Planned enhancements section) we will only earn partial credit.** :"")

Looks good! Just some minor formatting issues which I'm not sure if you want to address. Unfortunately I'm using Windows, as I don't use a Mac/Linux:

For the find function, there are no line breaks between the tasks being found, so everything appears in a single line:
![Screenshot 2024-09-20 142223](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a06a53c-ee33-495c-b4ca-8ecfd31349c9)

Also, the month in your expected output for the "delete" function on your user guide seems to be appearing a bit strangely. Again, a minor issue:
![Screenshot 2024-09-20 142835](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f574d6df-f355-4869-b902-2721037c1eb1)

Lastly, just a suggestion but maybe you could add a link to your releases page in the "Quick Start" section in your user guide?

Other than that, everything seems to be working well!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Markdown hyperlink issues**

Hello, I'm currently facing an issue regarding my User Guide an whereby in my table of contents, I am referencing a later part of my UG with the header ``` ### Clearing all entries : `clear` ```. However, in the table of contents itself, intelliJ is making me reference it this way for the hyperlink `#clearing-all-entries--clear`. When I try to put a single `-` between "entries" and "clear", it gives an "unable to resolve..." message. Moving on to my actual MarkBind website containing my user guide, when I click the sub-headers in the table of contents, the url is directed to `https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f09-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#clearing-all-entries--clear` (with the double -), but it does not actually take me to the relevant sections. Whereas when I click on the side bar, it brings me to `https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f09-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#clearing-all-entries-clear` (with the single -) and correctly brings me to the relevant sections. But then I am unable to hyperlink it using only a single `-` as intelliJ is unable to resolve it.

> > For me I don't actually has method that print out different command error, I had a parent class for Exception (`ToothlessException`) and some inherited class that represent different type of error such as `MissingIndexException`, `MissingDescriptionException` and etc. Each has used the `super(String errorMessage)` in their own constructor to pass the error message to be printed. And I used `try` `catch` in my `main()` method to print the message from the exception via `e.getMessage()`. Not sure is this the best way to do it but it reduce the need to create lots of methods in the `Ui` class to print the messages. Hope it will helps!

Hi there! Yes, that would be how I implemented the exceptions too. If you have not added the JavaFX, it would be wherever you have your `while` loop. If you have added JavaFX, you could add the `try-catch` block in the `getResponse()` method and instead of printing, you can return the error message as a String. Both this method would allow you to continue using the application even after the error is thrown.

Hello, i did some simple testing and here are my comments!

Overall, the features all seem to work fine without any issues! However, here are some things that you may want to look into further! I have attached screenshots so that you may reproduce the steps I have taken. Hope this helps!

Pressing the send button creates empty chatboxes. May not be intended?

For event:
Keying in the wrong event format command produces the error "You are manipulating position out of bounds" which may not be an accurate error statement to display to users.

![event](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8f40de5-26e3-49e3-af8d-5ba1ac57a99b)

For deadline:
Similar to invalid event format command, the same error message is produced which may not be intended.

![deadline bot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/531b6536-aaeb-4a17-ba17-31f6b2b83b04)

Your user guide might have an slight typo: `deadlind `instead of `deadline`

![deadline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b88831e-b1f7-4701-9c15-038e1e536c8e)

Data storage:
Modifying the .txt file leads to the application not launching. Can possibly look into that if you have the time. (i.e. skip lines or produce error) See entry number 7, where the description is removed.

I think you can leave it as it is, as I won't consider that to be a magic literal. Magic literals (or strings) are defined as those whose meaning could not be understood without any additional context. 

In this case, the string: `I have sorted the list for you~ &hat;_&hat;\nThis is your new task list.` is quite self-explanatory as an output string, and anyone reading it will understand without prior context. Nonetheless, it doesn't hurt to declare it as a constant, and passing the constant as the parameter. 😄

Hi, windows user here! Looks mostly good to me, just a few suggestions:

1. Allow the user to enter timings in addition to just dates for deadlines and events, as this enhances the functionality of your bot. 
2. A welcome message would be good when the user enters the app. 
3. There can be a check to see if a user is marking/unmarking a task that has already been marked or unmarked respectively - reminding the user that they have already marked/unmarked the task. 
4. There can also be a check to see if the event start time is later than or equal to the event end time when adding a new event task.

Hey y'all, I'm from the same team as @Jianwen0451 and we managed to fix the issue. We are pretty sure that we have set up the team repo correctly (codecov, tokens, repo settings and all that) but the Java CI just wasn't running.

Here's how we fixed it: 
1. Create a new workflow in GitHub Actions
2. Choose Java with Gradle
3. Rename the file to something else other than gradle.yml (gradletest.yml for example)
4. Copy and paste the content of gradle.yml into gradletest.yml
5. Commit to repo

After we did these steps, we had two Java CI's and they both started running. Now, we can disable the new Java CI workflow and the old one should now be functioning correctly. So basically, adding a new workflow kickstarted the Java CI.

As for what caused this issue in the first place, we have no clue.

Hi @rayray39, just had a few suggestions, but take note that this is just my opinion.
1.  It works great on windows, but perhaps you might want to create a subfolder named `data`and then place the `janet.txt` inside it. i.e. `data/janet.txt` is the path of the saved tasks file.
2.  Perhaps you can add the functionality of the chatbot exiting if the user types in the `bye` command.  You can try this by adding an exit animation. This is an excerpt from my code that tries to do it (although it can be cleaner) :
```java
    private void exitApplicationWithDelay(double seconds) ``{``
        PauseTransition delayAnimation = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(seconds));
        delayAnimation.setOnFinished(event -&gt; Platform.exit());
        delayAnimation.play();
    ``}``
    private void handleUserInput() ``{``
    ...
      if (response.equals("EXIT MESSAGE")) ``{``
              dialogContainer.getChildren().addAll(
                      encloseUserInput(input),
                      encloseNedInput(ned.getByeMessage(), false));
              exitApplicationWithDelay(2);
              return;
          ``}``
   ``}``
```

Overall, good job!

Hey! I am a windows user, everything seems great on my end, I tried using an invalid date: 2019-99-99 and even though the bot didn't respond, it could still function afterwards so really good error handling!

All the commands work well and the GUI is pretty dope, only problem I faced was with this error, I am guessing you used scene builder to customise the GUI, and didn't change the JavaFX version back as scenebuilder will auto modify the JavaFX version in your .fxml files to use Java version 22 by default

Great job!

I think the issue is with the java version. Ensure your java version is correct by doing `java -version` as referenced by this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html). If you installed java with sdkman, the issue is with the java source path.

Try running this command: `source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"`. If it works, append this line to your config by doing `echo source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" >> ~/.zshrc` (it looks like you are using zsh shell)

Hello! Windows user here, works fine for me too! 

On top of the previous discussions, perhaps it may be useful to add a title at the title bar of the window to facilitate the screenshot for the submission.

Pretty UI!

Hi! I ran your jar file on macOS Sonoma 14.2 and no error is encountered. Same observations as @LowXiSi. One more thing is that the GUI can be shifted left and right, not sure if its intended that way. 
Overall, it looks great to me, good job on having the error messages appear in a different colour!

I accidentally missed the submission deadline for the canvas survey tP: AB3 Initial Experience, and I am aware that the submission will be shared with my team members later for the team project, but I can no longer submit anything as the quiz is now locked :-( Would there be a way for a late submission to go through so that my suggestions can still be shared?

Hi, good job on your IP! I'm a windows user but I thought I'll still help test things out. Mostly everything looks good to me, except when I use the unmark command, the formatting of the response appears to be slightly off. Also, when adding a task with dates, it appears that I can set the date to be anything, even strings like "tomorrow" or empty strings. It might be good to fix this before the final submission. All the best!

Everything looks good to me! (Windows user) Only issue I found was being able to add an event where the start time is after the end time.

Greetings! I faced a similar issue, turns out, I did not deploy the site on githube pages correctly... Make sure on the settings of your team's forked repo, under pages, it says "gh-pages" "root" and not "master" "docs"... Once I updated it, wait for a few minutes and it worked!

Not sure if this will help, but yeah :DDDD

It looks good in my OS(window), but just that the program does not handle non-positive value like if I type 
`mark 0`, it caused a java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException in the terminal but it was not reflected in the chatbot.

Hi, just tried out your chatbot v1.1. No issues on windows end. (Also, it looks awesome). I tested also reopening it to see if the data is persistent and it is.   

I would say the only small issue I had is that when I type a command in an incorrect format it says Danger, invalid command format but it does not tell me the format I should use.

Hi, everything looks great on my end on Windows. Maybe you could introduce a bit of personalization and their were a couple of minor errors such as for the command 'list -1', the bot would still print out the list. In the case for 'delete -1', I was unable to send the message.
