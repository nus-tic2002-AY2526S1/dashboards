Is there any reason why the try catch is done here?

I believe the Kunkka.java already catches such an exception. Though understandably it appears that its more so for executing the command rather than creating the command. 

However since the try catch returns null, the Kunkka code might catch an exception due to null.execute() instead.

Oh thats my bad, I meant to say that `FindCommand`, a noun might be a more appropriate class name than `Find` a verb. 

`CommandFinder` would however imply that the class finds commands rather than a command that handles finding, which I believe is not the intended meaning here.

minor nitpick: might be better to use more descriptive variable names in this function. you've got single-letter variable names that refer to different types of objects (a `File`, `Scanner`, `*Task`, and `Exception`). yes this is technically allowed by the coding standard, but having more descriptive names would aid readability in my opinion &hat;-&hat;

consider making this a try-with-resources, so that the `FileWriter` is automatically closed for you. right now, you're only closing the `FileWriter` within the main `try` block, so if an exception is thrown, you're not actually closing it. this could also be done with a `finally` block.

might be worth making a method dedicated to inserting the separating lines, and inserting a message in between! you're duplicating a lot of code to insert lines, and it's spread throughout multiple files. if you ever decide to change the format of ZBOT's responses in the future, you'd only need to change it in this one method, rather than the much larger refactor of finding it in multiple locations throughout your project. it might be manageable at this point with relatively few LoC, but it'll become a much bigger headache at larger project sizes.

as mentioned in the comment on `Ui.java`, consider abstracting the separating line code to its own method in `Ui`, and call that new method everywhere else instead.

overall, a pretty neat implementation, and largely adheres to coding standards! also a decent first pass at implementing Gradle and JUnit, though more tests could definitely be added. it's also very well-documented with javadocs, so good job on that (or clever use of an LLM) &hat;-&hat;

i do have some minor nitpicks and suggestions, but it's nothing major and overall this codebase should be good enough for the rest of the iP!

you should probably include a `.gitignore` file too, because you've pushed some binaries and unnecessary files that should be kept out of the repo for DevOps purposes. the main project has a good starting template, and [GitHub themselves have very good templates for you to use too](https://github.com/github/gitignore)!

noticing that you're not adding .jar files to this gitignore, might be better for DevOps purposes to include them, just so that you (or collaborators) aren't accidentally committing any unnecessary files/build artifacts!

[GitHub themselves have a nice collection of .gitignore templates that are free for all to use](https://github.com/github/gitignore); i'd recommend using the relevant ones for your platform!

overall, it's a decent first attempt! there are a few violations of the coding standard, but nothing too egregious 👍 

there is one error in line 9 of `Task.java` that causes your project to not compile; you're trying to compare a `boolean` to an `int`. java has strict typing, so that won't work - but it would've worked if this was a JavaScript project instead :p

however, you should start adding in header comments/javadocs for all of your methods soon. consider using github copilot/your favourite llm of choice to help with that! you get copilot premium access for free with the [github student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack), and it's completely free to sign up for. github copilot's also got intellij integration too.

EDIT: oh yeah, you should also consider starting to add in Gradle integration + JUnit unit tests :p

For all errors related to the user's syntax error, I think that you can add another line to show them the correct thing to do. For this one as example, the message can be like:

`Sorry! The name of a to do cannot be empty.`
`Please specify the to do in the format: to do [task_description]!`

With this, the user would immediately know the correct thing to do without needing to open the help section 😄

Your approach is completely fine, but I just want to share my perspective, so that both of us benefit. My approach for this is that I use a HashMap that maps from the command string to a function, in this case, it will look like this:

```java
new HashMap<String, Function<Void, Void>> dummyNameHashMap;
```

and then your block of execution code will become 
```java
() -&gt; dialog.getStyleClass().add('some-class')
```
then your changeDialogStyle will be:
```java
private void changeDialogStyle(String commandType) ``{``
    this.dummyNameHashMap.get(commandType).apply();
``}``
```

For my side, I have one method Storage::load(TaskList) as a single entry point of interaction. Then, Parser.java, upon receiving a Task, will invoke TaskList::add(Task) and Storage::saveTask(Task). In my opinion, these two are two standalone entities.

But of course, there is no one correct design, and I would love to hear about your rationale behind your design 😄. From what I see, you hide the Storage away from your Ally.java, and I am curious about this too.

A little nit, the naming convention for test methods is:
```java
public void testFeature_testScenario_expectedBehavior();
```

For example,
```java
public void toString_deadlineTask_correctFormat();
```

If you do not have the second and third part, it may imply to a person from its name, that testToString of yours will test all possible scenarios. 

Other than that, the test looks comprehensive to me!

My approach for this is to replace the switch-case with a map to map from the command to the action:
```java
new HashMap<String, Function<Void, Void> dummyNameHashMap;
```

Then, you can do:
```java
try ``{``
    this.dummyNameHashMap.get(userInput.split``{``" ")[0]).apply();
``}`` catch (YowException e) ``{``
    // something
``}``
```

But of course, that is just my design, and it does not mean that any design is better than the other!

Perhaps the savedata folder should be added to gitignore? This would be confusing to end-users if this is built for release, unless its explicitly labelled as an example(s).

In addition, packages are not meant to be written to at runtime. I would recommend moving the save location to a folder located in the project root directory.

Overall, the code is simple and straightforward, though there are some methods/variables whose name does not clearly describe their purpose in context. I have also noticed a few potential issues in the code that may affect maintainability. 

Likewise, I would suggest moving the argument parsing out of `Task` subclasses and into `Parser` to clearly separate their responsibilities.

Overall, I found the naming convention of your code to be quite well done, and you have also closely followed the Java coding standards. However, I've noted down some minor coding standard violations here and there and some method/ variable names that I think could be made slightly more intuitive. There was a part where a series of very long if-else statements could be found, consider using switch case for better readability if that makes sense.

hmm the deep nesting might prove a bit hard to read, u might consider either:
- creating a `Command` class and abstracting out some stuff ... OR
- make it a single try-catch at the start, and catching the errors at the bottom one by one 

this is what i did for my Parser class, just some idea
```java
        if (userInput.startsWith("find")) ``{``
            String[] parts = userInput.split(" ");
            if (parts.length == 1) ``{``
                throw new WrongCommandException("Uh oh! Bob says...the search term cannot be empty.");
            ``}``
            if (parts.length > 2) ``{``
                throw new WrongCommandException("Uh oh! Bob says...the search term must only be 1 word.");
            ``}``
            String searchTerm = parts[1];
            return new FindCommand(searchTerm);
        ``}``
```

EDIT: actually the return null thing right below this is v nice

consider putting the filepath as a static final String within the `Storage` class, and then tell the Storage class to create file if not exists etc etc

tip is you can use a static block
```java
static ``{``
    // will run even before instantiation
    // e.g. createFileIfNotExists()
``}``
```

String taskInfo = taskList.todoTask(userInput); is repeated for each type of task. You could create a helper function to avoid repeating this in each if block. taskListSize is also calculated multiple times. It could be moved outside of the conditional blocks to reduce redundancy.

You are checking the case with userInput.startsWith("todo") || userInput.startsWith("Todo"). It might be clearer and more concise to convert the user input to lowercase (e.g., userInput.toLowerCase().startsWith("todo")). This way, you only need to check for one case (e.g., todo) and improve maintainability.

Naming conventions are not always followed for variable and method names. They should be in camelCase without any _ since Java is used instead of Python. 

Boolean variables should be renamed to sound more like booleans i.e. isDone instead of done.

 Javadocs has not been added yet. 

Overall, the code is still readable, but many improvements can be made. All the best!

Your ```input.txt``` file looks like it tests most of your commands! But could I ask if there are other tests that have yet to be included? e.g. creating invalid ```Todo```, ```Deadline``` and ```Event```.

Overall, LGTM! Your code just has a few nits here and there. They are mainly just coding standard violations.

Note: If you can configure your ```checkstyle.xml``` and your IDE, that should help with identifying the violations easier. ATB!

Your UI class is handling more responsibilities than just displaying UI elements. Consider extracting out these extra responsibilities to other classes. 

A suggestion would be to have your storage, scanner, parser and taskList fields be in main instead and perform their work there.

It's a cool design choice to have your user be prompted for index until a correct one is given when CRUD operations(e.g. mark, delete). However, if a user were to input it by mistake, they have no way of cancelling the command except for inputting a valid index.

I would like to mention that this is my 2nd PR review so I am not putting much focus on the coding standard, but instead code quality (with a focus on naming). The code here has some interesting and cool design choice (e,g, prompting user for a correct input after a command is locked in) but needs to be careful of over extending the functionality classes.

You are making good progress in catching up. Aside from a few minor coding violations and some long pieces of code, everything else look fine. Before you progress into later weeks of the IP, it would be good to install the checkstyle scripts from week 4 to help you check coding standard violation. Aside from that, configuring your IDE to fit the coding standard is available in week 2 or 3 so perhaps you can skim through and configure it now.

Referring to above comment, then this can read data from the class instead of printing manually, and may be easier to manage if down the line there may be methods that require reading class type (i.e. sort by task type)

Nothing wrong with the switch statement here, but consider using a lambda switch statement. Might prevent fall-through of cases.

Perhaps it would be good if you can rename your variable name 't' to something more descriptive such as 'taskToAdd' so that it follows the coding standard more closely? Overall, I still find your code easy to read and understand!

Perhaps you can define certain repetitive hard-coded strings as constants to help increase your code maintainability and align with the coding standards more closely? For example, perhaps you can consider:

`private static final String BY_KEYWORD = "/by";`
`private static final String DEADLINE_DESCRIPTION = "Usage: \"deadline Description /by By\"";`

Ahh i see i see with regards to the scratch variable, but i wont deny the fact that the code still looks clean though. It's just i think perhaps is better to rename the variable 't' to 'task' for better clarity, so that it better aligns with the coding standard i guess?

Ohhh i see, thanks for the clarification though and my bad on this then!

and with regards to the comment improvements, perhaps you can include your "validateIndex" part into the JavaDoc comments.

So perhaps something like this?

```Java
/**
 * Validates if the 1-based index is within the bounds of the list.
 * <p>
 *     The validateIndex method in ``{``@code TaskList``}`` also throws AuroraException when ...
 * </p>
 * @param index the 1-based index to be validated.
 * @throws AuroraException if the index is out of bounds.

Is there any reason as to why you did not invoke a `super.toString()` method? Task is the parent class of all other task types like `Deadline` , `Event` and `Todo`.

Overall really well done! Note worthy things are the good abstractions of the different classes and packages, also created your own exceptions, however does not seem to add javadocs to the files and could have utilised the built in exceptions better. Great work!

If I am also not mistaken, I believe `switch case` on String variable is done with Hash lookup, which results in an O(1) lookup rather than chaining `if else` statements which could result in O(n), where `n` is the number of conditions.

Consider extracting the marking and unmarking action as separate methods within TaskList as you may need to add exception handling for invalid numbers.

            tasks.mark(indexToMark - 1) // suggested change
            try ``{``
                String filePath = "./data/tasks.txt";
                Task firstTask = tasks.get(0);
                storage.writeToFile(filePath, firstTask);

Since this extends from Task, perhaps you may want to add an Override? This comment applies to your other objects where there is no Override notation.

Instead of the if-else approach used here, you could use a more object-oriented approach. By having a method getTaskType() in each of the "ToDo", "Deadline" and "Event" file, it would use polymorphism for better code clarity.

e.g. 
public class ToDo extends Task ``{``

    public String getTaskType() ``{``
        return "T";
    ``}``

perhaps we should import the classes we need explicitly, looks like you only need BufferredReader and PrintWriter? Noticed this issue in Parser.java as well!

perhaps this method should be broken up into smaller chunks? 

From Code Quality [Avoid Long Methods](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#code-quality)
```
Avoid long methods as they often contain more information than what the reader can process at a time. 
Consider if shortening is possible when a method goes beyond 30 LoC. 
The bigger the haystack, the harder it is to find a needle.

This part is a little unclear to me. Is this error message supposed to be displayed to the user or stored as the task description? Perhaps you could add some code comments?
Since this is a constructor, the Deadline object will still be created provided an exception is thrown. Perhaps you could extract the checking logic elsewhere and only pass valid parameters to the constructor.

I like that you used switch case here. 
The course suggests a specific style for switch-case formatting, should we align with that?

I like how you've handled exceptions here, but maybe it would be better to standardize a custom error message across all cases under YukiException etc. for better user experience?

You could use System.err.println to show the error message in red in the terminal

Instead of using raw string values for commands, should we use an Enum?  
This would allow us to store all command names in a centralized Enum file, making it easier to manage and update command names.  Additionally, we could add a function in the Enum to normalize user input for handling uppercase and lowercase, ensuring consistent processing  of commands

I like that you're aiming to create a generic type for TaskList. However, I noticed that this constructor directly references taskList from storageList, meaning both instances share the same reference. 

Doesn't this go against the idea of having a generic task list?

I'm not sure what convention our course follows for getters, but the name is functional. It might be worth considering simplifying it to isDone to better align with Java naming conventions for boolean getters, if that works for the style we're aiming for.

It might be helpful to replace "due" with something more descriptive, like dueDate, as "due" could refer to different things depending on the context. For example, "due" could refer to a payment due date, which might be confusing in this context. Using a more specific name like dueDate would make the purpose clearer. Using a more specific name would improve clarity.

It looks like there isn’t a validation check for taskId before accessing taskList. If the input isn’t a valid number or is out of bounds, it might cause the program to crash. It might be helpful to add a check to ensure taskId is within a valid range before attempting to remove the task. That way, users won’t run into unexpected errors.

Just a suggestion, but using StringBuilder instead of string concatenation inside a loop could improve performance. It might be worth considering for efficiency!

```java
StringBuilder fullList = new StringBuilder("Here are the tasks in your list:\n");
for (int i = 0; i < listCount; i++) ``{``
    fullList.append(i + 1).append(".").append(taskLists.get(i)).append("\n");
``}``
return fullList.toString();

It might be helpful to catch more specific exceptions in addition to IOException and provide additional context in the error messages. For example, you could separate FileNotFoundException and IOException and give a bit more detail on the error. It could look something like this:
```java
try ``{``
    // file operations
``}`` catch (FileNotFoundException e) ``{``
    System.out.println("Error: The specified file was not found.");
``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
    System.out.println("Error: An unexpected I/O error occurred.");
``}``
```

Your attention to detail is evident throughout the project. For example, the handling of specific task types with their own classes not only keeps the code clean but also makes it scalable for future features. The exception handling is robust, and I noticed that you're mindful of giving clear error messages, which enhances debugging and user experience. You've also ensured that the UI is welcoming and intuitive, which contributes positively to the overall user experience by making interactions feel smooth and straightforward. Keep up the great work!

Code is relatively easy to read and understand, do remember to stick to the style conventions (remove all the unnecessary linebreaks)! Class abstraction feels slightly overwhelming, I would think about extracting common methods to existing classes (e.g. the methods in CommandResult could be absorbed into the main Command class and have the subclasses override the method as needed).

Nit: TaskList tests are too long IMO, particularly the methods that test the adding of a lot of tasks. Testing adding one of each type of task would be sufficient if the test goal was to add multiple tasks as a single string input.

I think `taskList` would be the better option! This class would only represent one task list that contains multiple tasks, so it would either be `taskList` or `tasks`!

Not a coding quality standard comment(?), but I would think about only asking the Parser class to parse data and nothing more (e.g. adding the task, saving tasks to storage)! This will help in isolating the class for testing in case there are other issues with the TaskList and Storage classes :)

Project is well organised into packages! Some nits have already been pointed out by other reviewers (e,g, getter naming convention). I would think about dereferencing class if possible (as mentioned in the Parser class) as it seems quite tough to carry out isolated unit tests with the current structure.

P.S. Baymax concept is super cute!

Looks like a redundant private getter here, it doesn't perform any meaningful actions beside returning the raw attribute. Consider just referring to the attribute directly.

Overall, the logic of your code makes sense so good job!

Considering that both cases are almost equal other than the first string, consider using the tertiary statement to handle only the first part (`[D] [X]`). Something like:
```java
return (super.getIsdone() ? "[D] [X] " : "[D] [ ]") + super.getTask() + ...
```

Moreover, given that other child classes of Task also have this `[X]` and `[ ]` checkbox, consider creating a new method in Task that returns the checkbox together with the Task string. This way, you can avoid having this check in all child classes of Task.

I think your code is extremely organised and I have a lot to learn from you. I like the way you packaged and compartmentalised your classes and even for your exceptions. The way you read from the textfile to update the taskList was also innovative. Overall, great job on this and Angela will definitely be a hit.

Overall, code is easy to follow but I feel that a little more abstraction could be done, regarding the timeParser in the Task class. Class descriptions were also a bit too long, should try to keep them succinct and summarised. Some functions that were not getters or setters also did not have documentations. Naming conventions were consistent and correct. Overall, good job!

Overall, I found your code easy to read for the most part except a few places
where the nesting was too deep. I noted a few minor coding standard violations
too. Some of the classes are getting quite long. Consider splitting into
smaller classes if that makes sense.

Overall, I found your code a bit hard to read as the `Main` class assumes too many responsibilities. You might consider breaking it into components such as `Storage`, `Ui`, and `TaskList`. Also, there are several coding standard violations you may want to address.

Hi! I think this variable should be renamed as something like `splitInput` since the codestyle says that in general, variables should be written in `camelCase`. It also says that collections of stuff like lists should be in plural form, but given the variable here, I'm not really sure if `splitInputs` is exactly accurate either.

Hi! The codestyle guide for CS2103T mentions that the switch case block should not have an extra indent for the case clauses, so it should look something like this
```java
switch (cmd) ``{``
case LIST:
    // Something
    break;
case BYE:
    // Something
    // ...

Hi! I think this is another variable that does not follow the `camelCase` naming convention, and I see quite a few more below. I think it might be a good idea to ctrl+F for `_`s in your code to find and rename variables from `snake_case` to `camelCase`. I also made this mistake at first and had to spend a bit of time fixing it a week or two ago.

Hi! I think this line, when including the indent, exceeds 120 characters. In the CS2103T style guide, it mentions 110 chars as a soft limit and 120 chars as a hard limit for the line length, so maybe a line break can be added somewhere.

Line 11: Is there any particular reason why this line is separate from the other imports? (Lines 5 to 9) It is inconsistent in different files. For example, MarkCommand.java has combined them all:

```java
package taskmax.command;

import taskmax.exception.TaskmaxException;
import taskmax.storage.Storage;
import taskmax.storage.TaskList;
import taskmax.ui.Ui;
```

While Parser.java has separated them by subpackages:

```java
package taskmax.parser;

import taskmax.command.AddCommand;
import taskmax.command.Command;
import taskmax.command.DeleteCommand;
import taskmax.command.ExitCommand;
import taskmax.command.ListCommand;
import taskmax.command.MarkCommand;
import taskmax.command.UnmarkCommand;
import taskmax.command.FindCommand;

import taskmax.exception.TaskmaxException;

import taskmax.task.Deadline;
import taskmax.task.Event;
import taskmax.task.ToDo;

import taskmax.ui.Ui;
```

I think I like how it is implemented in Parser.java more.

Based on the Java Coding guide, switch statements should have the following indentation:

```java
switch (condition) ``{``
case ABC:
    statements;
    // Fallthrough
case DEF:
    statements;
    break;
case XYZ:
    statements;
    break;
default:
    statements;
    break;
``}``
```

Should be an easy fix for lines 37-76 though! Just Ctrl-Tab the entire contents of the Switch block.

From the Java Coding standard:
```
You MUST write header comments for all classes, public methods. But they can be omitted for the following cases:
i. Getters/setters
ii. When overriding methods (provided the parent method's Javadoc applies exactly as is to the overridden method)
```

For the toString method, I think it may be okay if there is no JavaDoc. This will apply to the other types of tasks too.

This is not written explicitly in the coding standard, but I think it would improve readability:

Original at Lines 25 and 26:
```java
        System.out.println(LINE + intro + LINE + new Mascot() + LINE
                + "\nEnter \"hello!\" to begin\n" + LINE);
```
Suggestion:
```java
        System.out.println(LINE + intro + LINE + new Mascot() + LINE + "\n"
                + "Enter \"hello!\" to begin\n" 
                + LINE);
```

By ending each code line with a \n, it makes it very clear what the output might look like. This could apply to intro and new Mascot() too!

I believe the imports from Standard Java should be placed above other imports, so Lines 7 to 9 will now be above Lines 3 to 5. Don't fix this now though, I found it much easier to fix all these problems in one go after I had run gradle checkstyle to automatically flag out all coding standard errors. 😄

According to the coding [standards](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html) given to us, the spacing within the switch() statement should be 4-spaces long. It seems that this code use tabs instead. Maybe you could consider changing your editor formatting settings?

It's not quite clear what's the distinction between the member method `saveTasksToFile()` and the class method `loadTasksFromFile()`. Why one of them is static and the other is not, if the class don't have any member variables anyway? Maybe for consistency they both should have the same structure?

Also, it could be nice to have a way to pass a file path into Storage to make it more flexible instead of using hard-coded path. For example, when testing a Storage we'd want to make it save to a special testing directory instead of the default data one.

Overall great job on the naming conventions. One thing maybe you could look at is the need to create a new file every time you introduce a new command. Maybe this can be more compact?

Great job on the implementation! 🎉 To improve readability and maintainability, I suggest adding Javadoc comments for both your classes and methods. This will help clarify their purpose, expected inputs, return values, and any potential exceptions they might throw. Providing detailed documentation will also make it easier for others (and your future self!) to understand and use your code effectively. Keep up the good work! 👍

Good use of `IllegalArgumentException()`! However, you might consider defining a custom task-related exception instead. This would make error handling more specific and prevent potential confusion in the future if other parts of the codebase also throw `IllegalArgumentException()` for different reasons. A custom exception would improve clarity, maintainability, and debugging.

You might consider abstracting this chunk of code responsible for saving data into a separate class, such as `SaveFile.java`. This would improve code readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns, making it easier to understand and debug in the future.

I like the descriptive comments as it make the code easier to understand, building onto @zacklow28 suggestion,  you might consider renaming the `line` variable to something more specific, such as `taskEntry` or `fileLine`, to better reflect its purpose

looking at the `saveTasksToFile()` method,`taskEntry` might be a more consistent choice for maintaining clarity across both methods

Overall, its a neat class code base, but you have missed putting the correct JavaDoc format in each of the public methods and classes.

Also, I highly recommend for you to extract each classes into another file and relevant packages, as to align with the aim of moreOOP increment level in week 3 task.

Just a possible alternative: instead of setting the command names in parser, we can add a getKeyword() method to each command to make use of abstraction! E.g. getKeyword() for MarkCommand would return "mark". That way, in parser, we just need to check if tmp equals the command keyword.

Overall, LGTM. The code was easy to read and mostly follows Java coding standards. There was also a good use of OOP principles, breaking down larger classes into smaller ones. Good job! I especially liked the use of immutability and exception handling, which makes the code more robust and maintainable.

Nice JavaDoc added! Also, when writing Javadocs for overridden methods, the **@inheritDoc tag** can be used to reuse the header comment from the parent method but with further modifications e.g., when the method has a slightly different behavior from the parent method (this applies to other subclasses of Command class too).

The naming of "task type + Sub" and "task type + Desc" (e.g. deadlineSub, deadlineDesc) is consistent across the deadline and event commands. However, would it be better to replace them with "message" and "description", which does not use abbreviations and might be more straightforward?

1. I do not like it that you just extended Exception, this is generally considered bad practice in JAVA, particularly due to the consistent need of defining throws XXXException each time it is used, which quickly piles on in the throws section. Instead, i recommend using RuntimeException, which would be silent

2. I do not like it that there are no javadocs present particularly for Exception related classes as it makes it difficult to identify what kind of exceptional circumstance this is

According to [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html), you need a Javadoc for every public class and public method (with some exceptions). 😢 You can follow the [checkstyle guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html), so it'll automatically remind you to put a Javadoc.

I noticed that the setDoneOrUndone method in the Task class takes a String parameter ("mark" or "unmark") to determine the task’s status. According to coding standards, methods should avoid using strings for control logic, as this can lead to errors and reduce code clarity. Maybe do this under Parser and use a boolean when calling Task methods instead?

Your code looks really well organized and neat, with consistently good and descriptive names for methods and variables. The javadoc comments are also descriptive, clear and through. One relatively minor issue(?) I found is you only calling Storage.saveTaskList() when closing the program, but Task-7 states that saving on TaskList modification. Overall, it looks great.

The `java.*` imports should be above the others, and between each type of statement, there should be a blank line in between each import type.

I'm not sure how strict CS2103T is on this, but both the checkstyle and the JavaDoc examples show single-sentence function comments split with the comment open and closed on separate lines.

Theres just a couple of small convention issues, that should be quick to fix.

1. Order of import statements alphabetically, organized by type separated by a space. You can follow the guide they provided [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html). Unfortunately, a large number of files suffer from this, but others are ok. By chance when you run the IntelliJ formatter, have you been clicking `Only changes uncomited to VCS`? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/562b1d40-e81f-44b5-91fd-52abaf8729cb)

2. JavaDoc comment style. Sometimes for function documentation comments, you collapse them into a single line, which doesn't seem to align with the examples the course provided, nor the checkstyle. There are some examples [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html) as well.

Of course, these are very minor nitpicks you can solve in a few minutes! The PR was overall very thorough with descriptive comments for every function. Furthermore I felt the organization was clear and easy to follow for someone looking at your codebase for the first time, so good work!

Wishing you the best!

It's good that you have included javadoc comments for your classes and methods. However, there should be a space between the method description and the @param section. In this case, a space is needed between "Executed a given command." and "@param tasklist ..."

If adding space causes "./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest" to fail, you might need to navigate to the affected line and adjust the spacing by pressing backspace once without removing the extra line with "*".

It feels quite weird to me that there are no methods in the subclasses of task, perhaps you omitted it? Maybe it is your program's choice of design, but I would recommend you to have methods that are specific to this class, e.g: An override toString method to describe Todo tasks.

Do you think it's better to make this more generalized? I think that not only specific format is unable to be parsed, but other potential format might also have errors. 

My suggestion is telling the user that date cannot be parsed and give the user the correct format they need to follow.

I believe the switch statements that is not Lambda-style should be in this format:

            return taskList.listOut();
            // Fallthrough
        ``}``
```
Note the lack of indentation in the case statements, and the "break;" or "// Fallthrough" within every case statement as per the coding standard guidelines

Perhaps you could import the specific method instead of *?

From the coding standard guide, the rationale given was that "Importing classes explicitly gives an excellent documentation value for the class at hand and makes the class easier to comprehend and maintain".

Apart from that, very nice use of the OOP paradigm to split your classes based on their functionalities!

I think the coding standard mentions that conditionals should all be in braces and on separate lines. 
Also, perhaps it might be cleaner to use a switch statement for parsing the command here?

Just a design opinion: `LocalDateTime::parse` would expect the datetime format to be strictly `ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME`, failing which the catch block is entered.

 Great job using a short, descriptive name `flip()`. The method name is a clear verb. Also, the local variable `db` is short, but it’s in a small scope, so that’s aligned with “variables with a small scope can have short names.” Looks good under the naming rules!

A switch case would be easier to follow in term of logic inside the start() function.
We can use .split() to get the different parts of the input?
Then once we get the command we continue to process based off of  expected format.
Since the list of tasks is of type Task we can modify addTask to have signature addTask(Task t) as then we can add all 3 types without having to write 3 different methods.

Is it better to separate this into multiple lines? It could improve code readability by using having each "+" term on a new line.

Alternatively, String.format could be useful too! 😄 

```suggestion
        return "D | "
            + (isDone ? "1" : "0")
            + " | "
            + description
            + " | "
            + by;
```

or even:

```suggestion
        return String.format("D | %d | %s | %s", isDone ? 1 : 0, description, by);
```

Would it be better to change "by" to "dueDate" or "dueTime"? It informs us what the field is representing. This is especially important considering you are not using the LocalDate class (or its variants) for this field, so it is not clear what the purpose of the field is.

I think the code naming is generally fine, except for some of the issues pointed out. While it may be clear what the purpose is during declaration (as a field), if the variable is only used much further down in the code, it is a little hard to read as I have to trace back and try and find where you declared the variable. Apart from those few code naming issues, I think that most of the other variables are used pretty well (can understand their purpose).

LGTM! I like how all the responses are unique and ghost-related. The code is also easy to read with minor issues with regards to the course's java coding standard.

Remember to add javadoc comments!

I think the previous reviewer may have meant the names of the `enum`. For instance, instead of naming them `CREATE_FILE_ERROR` and `DATE_ERROR`, they were suggesting to rename them to `ERROR_CREATE_FILE` and `ERROR_DATE`. They may have been referring to the guideline "Associated constants should have a common prefix." from the Java coding standard.
(I personally think the guideline "Related things should be named similarly, while unrelated things should NOT." from [Coding Quality: Naming](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/website/schedule/week4/topics.html#w4-6-code-quality-naming) would be more applicable here, and that your current naming convention works alright.)

LGTM. You're probably still in the process of doing the other iP tasks so all the best in getting those done! Some suggestions from me would be to split everything into packages, and further extract out all the methods into objects (such as different command types or Ui classes). And remember to add your javadoc comments! [👍]

I think the first try block is redundant and can be removed. You can instead open the BufferedWriter with false for append mode, which should already overwrite the file

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; taskList.size(); i++) ``{``

Don't you think that the creation of a new `Object[]` is redundant here?

My suggestion is to remove this line and get the task object directly from the given `List&lt;task>` as `lst.get(num - 1)`.

You are using `split("/by")`. This might not handle cases where users accidentally add extra spaces. 

Using regex like `split("\\s*/by\\s*")` to ensure trimming of spaces around `/by`, making it more user-friendly

In overall, I liked your code naming conventions as they were easy to read and follow. Your code also looks well organised and clean. Just a few suggestions:

1. Maybe you could use System.lineSeparator() instead of "\n"?
2. "list" might be sounding a bit too vague. I noticed in other parts of the codebase you referred to it as "tasks" or "taskList" which sounds more descriptive of what the list holds. Maybe you can try switching to the latter?

Otherwise, a job well done!

1. There were inconsistencies (but very few) in the way the import statements were grouped (e.g., Parser.java and Storage.java).
2. Maybe you can try replacing "\n" with System.lineSeparator()?
3. I noticed dewTest.java contains dummy test cases. Will you be adding more test cases in the future?

In overall, your code looked very organised, clean and was easy to read and follow. I liked how your test cases were well formatted with descriptions for each test case. I also liked how you made use of `@BeforeEach` annotation to setup the necessary variables for your test cases. Good job!

I believe this was mentioned by @nickt121 as well but leaving a line between params and the header would be more aligned with the coding style standards. While this format seems to be standardised throughout your project, perhaps you could consider this minor update in your future iterations?

is TASK_NUMBER a constant value? Use camelCase instead of all uppercase if it's not a constant. To find what exactly are considered constants, you might want have a look on this page https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.2.4-constant-names

Great work on Helix! It's good that all variables use the correct case (camelcase, pascalcase, etc). The switch cases indentation also follow the proper indentation. Plus, it follows the use of proper indentation as recommended. And with the limiting of line length and use of egyptian braces, makes the code super readable! Lastly, it's amazing that you took the time to do javadocs for all private and public functions.

Good work on Tete! It's great that the code mostly follows the proper naming convensions as described in the docs, but one thing has caught my attention. Within your task classes, perhaps the `boolean done` variable could be more intuitively named? Other than that, I like that most variables have proper naming. Also, good use of proper use of nouns and verbs (like the toData function name).

In the case where `FileNotFoundException` was previously caught, perhaps the return value of this function should be something else, like an error value? I think an invalid return value like `-1` would be fitting, but maybe an `Optional&lt;Integer>` would help to denote error cases like this in a more type-safe way.

I appreciate the clear Javadoc comments, the efficient use of final for immutability, and the well-thought-out switch statement for task handling.

Just a suggestion, could the handle[Function] functions be abstracted into a Command (class/interface) with [Function]Command children (i.e. AddCommand, ListCommand) to declutter the Wooper.java class, as some of the handle[Function] functions have the same input and output types and could be replaced by a single function.

I am curious. Is there any particular reason why you choose to separate DukeExceptions into the many custom exception specific to the bot app? I am having a hard time deciding as to whether I should deal with my exception more generically (Eg. all exceptions will just be DukeException(CustomErrorMessage) or specifically (in your case). What if there are too many catch exceptions in one method?

As mentioned by @huangtian666 , I also like the choice of using lambda expression here. Any reason why you choose to separate this action(TaskList taskList) method from the getResponse(TaskList taskList) method? Both seems to have the same commands being run except for the returning of the responses.

To add on to what @huangtian666 mentioned, I think it will look neater if you could create a charlie.task package and group up all the relevant components together since you have already taken the time to extract task specific classes.

Is it better if the naming of methods stay more consistent? The previous method (sayBye) uses the word say to connotate that the method writes to command line. Perhaps doing so for other corresponding functions might make the code more readable?

I noticed that for the deadline branch, you checked for whether the task the user intended to delete was actually in the list. Could similar checks for the unmark and mark commands be implemented?

```
if (Integer.parseInt(parts[1]) > tasks.size()) ``{``
    throw new YeyException("Task to be deleted must exist within list");
``}``

# Is there a reason this is extracted out into a function?
I feel that there isn't a need to write functions for all the command classes to return a true/false based on whether to exit the program, especially since only the ExitCommand class is supposed to exit.
I'm curious to know if there's a reason for this design 😄 

Alternatively, you could store this as a a boolean attribute, or even handle the logic for exiting in your main app runner class.

```suggestion

            throw new YaleException(ignored.getMessage);
        ``}``

i think it would be good to throw an exception to surface up to the Yale bot so that the user can see that there is a problem reading the file if any

but between you and me, yolo

The chain of append looks verbose. Suggestion to just use normal string concatenation since performance isn't a concern here.

IMO, the System.out.println preferably should be one sentence/variable per line
E.g
System.out.println("I am bored. Let's play a game called: "
 /+ gameName
 /+ ". Whatever."

I think this is nicer because otherwise you have to scroll to the right.

Personally I think the constants should be set as private. Alternatively, it is better to places these constants in another class that is purely just data, no methods.
